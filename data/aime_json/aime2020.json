By the Binomial Theorem, \\begin{align*} \t\t149^n - 2^n &= (147+2)^n - 2^n \\\\ \t\t&= \\binom n1 \\cdot 147 \\cdot 2^{n-1} \t\t+ \\binom n2 \\cdot 147^2 \\cdot 2^{n-2}\\\\ \t\t&\\qquad+ \\binom n3 \\cdot 147^3 \\cdot 2^{n-3} \t\t+ \\cdots. \t\\end{align*} Because $147$ is divisible by $3$ , all terms after the first two are divisible by $3^3$ , and the exponent of $3$ in the first term is less than that in the second term. Hence it is necessary and sufficient that $3^3 \\mid 147n$ , that is, $3^2 \\mid n$ .\nFor the $7^7$ case, consider the same expansion as in the previous case. Because $147$ is divisible by $49 = 7^2$ , all terms after the first three are divisible by $7^7$ , and the exponent of $7$ in the first term is less than that in the second and third term. Hence it is necessary and sufficient that $7^7 \\mid 147n$ , that is, $7^5 \\mid n$ .\nFor the $5^5$ case, working modulo $5$ gives $149^n - 2^n \\equiv 4^n - 2^n = 2^n(2^n-1) \\pmod 5$ , so it must be that $4 \\mid n$ . Let $n = 4m$ , and let $c = 149^4 - 2^4 = (149^2-2^2)(149^2+2^2) = 147 \\cdot 151 \\cdot 22205$ . Note that $\\frac c5$ is an integer not divisible by $5$ . Expand by the Binomial Theorem again to get \\begin{align*} \t\t(149^4)^m - (2^4)^m &= (c+16)^m - (16)^m \\\\ \t\t&= \\binom m1 \\cdot c \\cdot 16^{m-1} \t\t+ \\binom m2 \\cdot c^2 \\cdot 16^{m-2} \\\\ \t\t&\\qquad+ \\binom m3 \\cdot c^3 \\cdot 16^{m-3} \t\t+ \\binom m4 \\cdot c^4 \\cdot 16^{m-4} \t\t+ \\cdots. \t\\end{align*} All terms after the first four are divisible by $5^5$ , and the exponent of $5$ in the first term is less than that in the second, third, or fourth term. Hence it is necessary and sufficient that $5^5 \\mid cm$ . Thus $5^4 \\mid m$ , and it follows that $4 \\cdot 5^4 \\mid n$ .\nTherefore the least $n$ is $3^2 \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 5^4) \\cdot 7^5$ . The requested number of divisors is $(1+2)(1+2)(1+4)(1+5) = 270$ .\n\nThe results of the above cases can be generalized using the following lemma.\n\nLifting the Exponent Lemma: Let $p$ be an odd prime, and let $a$ and $b$ be integers relatively prime to $p$ such that $p \\mid (a-b)$ . Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then the number of factors of $p$ that divide $a^n - b^n$ is equal to the number of factors of $p$ that divide $a-b$ plus the number of factors of $p$ that divide $n$ ."

Now $10 - 2x = 3x \\implies x = 2$ . Hence $D$ is at $(2, 0)$ . Let the point where $BE$ intersects $AC$ be $G$ and likewise $H$ for the point where $CF$ intersects $AB$ .

Doing similar things to finding the length of $AH$ , we get $AH = \\frac{24}{11}$ and $HB = \\frac{20}{11}$ .\n\nNow we find the equation of line $AC$ . The slope is just $\\frac{\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2} - 5} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ . Hence the equation of $AC$ is $y = -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3} + b$ and we can plug in point $(5, 0)$ because it lies on line $AC$ to get $0 = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{3} + b$ and solve to get the equation of line $AC$ is just $y = -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ .\n\nTherefore, any point on line $AC$ must have the form $(x, -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{3})$ . Let $G$ be at point $(x, -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{3})$ . We know $GC$ is just $\\frac{10}{3}$ so the distance between points $(x, -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{3})$ and $(5, 0)$ is just $\\frac{10}{3}$ . Solving, we get $x = \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{15}{2}$ but we know $x$ can at most be $5$ hence only $x = \\frac{5}{2}$ works. Thus, $G$ will be at point $(\\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{6})$ .\n\nThe same process applies for finding the coordinates of point $H$ .

We get $y = -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{7} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{7}$ .\n\nFinally, the last step is finding the equation of the perpendicular bisector of $AD$ . Note that the slope of $AD$ is just $\\frac{\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2} - 2} = -\\sqrt{7}$ . Hence the slope of the perpendicular bisector is just $\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{7}$ because that is the negative reciprocal of $-\\sqrt{7}$ .

Since the point $P$ of rotation must lie on both of these lines, we set them equal, solve and get: $x=21$ , $y=-3$ . We can also easily see that the degree of rotation is $90$ since $AB$ is initially vertical, and now it is horizontal. Also, we can just sketch this on a coordinate plane and easily realize the same.

The fact that $Q(0) = 2$ implies that $\\tfrac32(q-r) + qr = 2$ . Adding these two equations yields $q = -\\tfrac53$ , and so substituting back in to solve for $r$ gives $r=-\\tfrac{27}{19}$ .

So as long as $a+1 > 17$ , there will be a solution for $z$ in the interval.\n\nUsing this logic, we can find the number of solutions to $f(x) = y$ . For every interval $[a, a+1)$ where $a \\geq \\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor$ there will be one solution for $x$ in that interval. However, the question states $0 \\leq x \\leq 2020$ , but because $x=2020$ doesn't work we can change it to $0 \\leq x < 2020$ . Therefore, $\\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor  \\leq a \\leq 2019$ , and there are $2020 - \\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor$ solutions to $f(x) = y$ .\n\nWe can solve $f(y) = z$ similarly. $0 \\leq y < 2020$ to satisfy the bounds of $x$ , so there are $2020 - \\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor$ solutions to $f(y) = z$ , and $0 \\leq z < 2020$ to satisfy the bounds of $y$ .\n\nGoing back to $f(z) = 17$ , there is a single solution for z in the interval $[a, a+1)$ , where $17 \\leq a \\leq 2019$ . (We now have an upper bound for $a$ because we know $z < 2020$ .) There are $2003$ solutions for $z$ , and the floors of these solutions create the sequence $17, 18, 19, ..., 2018, 2019$\n\nLets first look at the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 17$ . Then $f(y) = z$ would have $2003$ solutions, and the floors of these solutions would also create the sequence $17, 18, 19, ..., 2018, 2019$ .\n\nIf we used the solution of $y$ where $\\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor = 17$ , there would be $2003$ solutions for $f(x) = y$ . If we used the solution of $y$ where $\\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor = 18$ , there would be $2002$ solutions for $x$ , and so on. So for the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 17$ , there will be $2003 + 2002 + 2001 + ... + 2 + 1 = \\binom{2004}{2}$ solutions for $x$\n\nIf we now look at the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 18$ , there would be $\\binom{2003}{2}$ solutions for $x$ . If we looked at the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 19$ , there would be $\\binom{2002}{2}$ solutions for $x$ , and so on.\n\nThe total number of solutions to $x$ is $\\binom{2004}{2} + \\binom{2003}{2} + \\binom{2002}{2} + ... + \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{2}{2}$ . Using the hockey stick theorem, we see this equals $\\binom{2005}{3}$ , and when we take the remainder of that number when divided by $1000$ , we get the answer, $\\boxed{10}$\n\n~aragornmf"
