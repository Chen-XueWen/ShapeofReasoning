Point D is on AC between A and C, and point E is on AB between A and B, such that AE = ED = DB = BC. I need to find the measure of angle ABC in degrees as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nSince it's an isosceles triangle with AB = AC, angles at B and C are equal. Let me denote angle ABC as β, so since AB = AC, angle ACB is also β, and angle BAC is some other angle, say α. Then in any triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees, so α + 2β = 180°.\n\nNow, there are points D and E with AE = ED = DB = BC. Let me denote this common length as x. So AE = ED = DB = BC = x.\n\nDB is part of AB, but AB is equal to AC, and since it's isosceles, let me find the lengths.\n\nAB is divided into AE and EB. Since E is between A and B, and AE = DB, but DB is not necessarily related directly, wait no.\n\nAE = ED = DB = BC = x.\n\nDB is a length from D to B, but D is on AC, so DB is a line from D to B, which might be different from the sides.\n\nAlso, AB = AC, and let's say AB has length y. Then since E is on AB, AE + EB = AB, but I don't know EB yet.\n\nGiven that AE = ED = DB = BC = x.\n\nDB = x, and BC = x, so in triangle DBC, DB = BC = x, so it's also isosceles with DB = BC.\n\nBut D is on AC, E on AB.\n\nAlso, ED = x, and AE = x.\n\nI should draw a sketch.\n\nLet me sketch triangle ABC, with AB = AC. So let's say A at the top, B and C at base, but since it's isosceles with AB=AC, angles at B and C are equal.\n\nNow, point D on AC, so between A and C. Point E on AB, between A and B.\n\nAE = ED = DB = BC = x.\n\nSo from A to E is x, then from E to D is also x, but D is not necessarily connected directly in terms of length yet.\n\nED is a line from E to D, which is given as equal to AE and DB and BC.\n\nAlso, DB = x, so B to D is x.\n\nAnd BC = x, so C to B is x.\n\nSince AB = AC, and let's say the common side lengths are such that...\n\nI need to find angle ABC, which is β.\n\nNow, since AB = AC, and we have points dividing sides or something.\n\nLet me denote the length of AB as c. Since E is on AB, AE + EB = AB.\n\nBut I know AE = x, but not EB yet.\n\nSimilarly, D is on AC, so AD + DC = AC.\n\nAC = AB = c, since it's isosceles with AB=AC.\n\nAB and AC are equal, let's call that length l. So AB = AC = l.\n\nNow, E is on AB, AE = x, but I don't know EB yet.\n\nDB = x, so from D to B is x.\n\nBC = x, so side BC is also x.\n\nAlso ED = x.\n\nMoreover, since AB = l, and AE = x, then EB = l - x.\n\nBut DB = x, and E is on AB, but D is not necessarily related directly.\n\nI should consider the triangles involved.\n\nSince there are equal lengths, I can assign variables to angles or use law of sines.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, in triangle ABC, AB = AC = l, BC = x (since BC = x).\n\nBC is given as x, and AB = AC = l, but l is not necessarily related to x yet.\n\nNow, angle at B is β, so by law of sines in triangle ABC:\n\nAB / sin(C) = BC / sin(A)\n\nStandard law of sines: a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C.\n\nSo in triangle ABC, side opposite A is BC = x, opposite B is AC = l, opposite C is AB = l.\n\nSince AB = AC, angles opposite them are equal, so angle B and angle C are equal, both β.\n\nAngle at A is α, with α + 2β = 180°.\n\nSide opposite A is BC = x.\n\nSides opposite B and C: since angle B is at vertex B, opposite side is AC. Angle C is at vertex C, opposite side is AB.\n\nAB and AC are both equal to l, so yes, sides opposite angles B and C are both l, so law of sines:\n\nx / sin α = l / sin β\n\nSince angles B and C are equal, and sides opposite are both l, but angle A is different.\n\nLaw of sines: a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C.\n\nSo side BC opposite angle A: length x, so x / sin α\n\nSide AB opposite angle C: length l, angle C is β, so l / sin β\n\nAB is between A and B, so it's opposite to angle C. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, AC is opposite to angle B, which is also β, so same as above.\n\nSo yes, x / sin α = l / sin β\n\nNow, we have points D and E.\n\nD is on AC, so AC is divided into AD and DC.\n\nE is on AB, so AB is divided into AE and EB.\n\nGiven that AE = ED = DB = BC = x.\n\nBC is already given as x.\n\nDB = x, but B to D: D is on AC, so BD is a line from B to D on AC.\n\nAlso ED = x, E is on AB, D on AC, so ED connects them.\n\nMoreover, since AE = x and DB = x, and BC = x.\n\nNow, also, the condition that AE = ED = DB = BC, all equal to x.\n\nBut I need another relation because l is unknown.\n\nPerhaps I can express everything in terms of β or find a way to relate.\n\nSince AB = AC = l, and E on AB with AE = x, so EB = l - x.\n\nD on AC with AD + DC = l.\n\nNow, DB = x, so distance from D to B is x.\n\nAlso ED = x, so distance from E to D is x.\n\nMoreover, BC = x.\n\nI could consider triangle ABD or something, but let's see the triangles.\n\nSince AE = ED and both are equal to x, in triangle AED, AE = ED = x, so it's isosceles with AE = ED.\n\nBut I don't know AD yet.\n\nAD is part of AC, which is l.\n\nI could use coordinates or vectors, but that might be complicated.\n\nAnother idea: since DB = BC = x, and AB = AC = l, perhaps triangle DBC is isosceles with DB = BC.\n\nD is on AC, so in triangle DBC, we have points D,B,C.\n\nDB = BC = x, so it's isosceles with DB = BC, so angles opposite them are equal.\n\nOpposite to DB is angle DCB, which is part of angle C of the big triangle.\n\nAngle at C in triangle ABC is β, and since AC is a side, but D is on AC, so when we look at triangle DBC, it's sharing angle at C.\n\nLet me denote the angles.\n\nFirst, let angle ABC = β, so angle BAC = α, angle ACB = β, with α + 2β = 180°.\n\nNow, BC = x, AB = l, AC = l.\n\nE is on AB such that AE = x.\n\nSince AB = l, EB = l - x.\n\nD is on AC such that DB = x and ED = x.\n\nAlso, since D is strictly between A and C, and E between A and B, probably all lengths are positive and less than the sides.\n\nNow, in triangle ABC, by law of sines: AB / sin β (angle opposite) wait no.\n\nSide opposite angle A is BC = x.\n\nAngle A is α, so x / sin α\n\nSide opposite angle B is AC = l, angle B is β, so l / sin β\n\nSo x / sin α = l / sin β ⇒ l = x * sin β / sin α\n\nBut α = 180° - 2β, since sum of angles.\n\nIn triangle ABC, angles are A:α, B:β, C:β, so yes, α + β + β = 180° ⇒ α = 180° - 2β.\n\nSo sin α = sin(180° - 2β) = sin 2β, because sin(180 - θ) = sin θ.\n\nsin(180 - θ) = sin θ, yes, so sin α = sin(180° - 2β) = sin 2β.\n\nAnd sin β is just sin β.\n\nSo l / x = sin β / sin α = sin β / sin 2β\n\nBut sin 2β = 2 sin β cos β, so l / x = sin β / (2 sin β cos β) = 1 / (2 cos β)\n\nAssuming sin β ≠ 0, which it isn't.\n\nSo AB / BC = l / x = 1 / (2 cos β)\n\nAB is opposite angle C, but anyway.\n\nNow, we have point E on AB with AE = x, so since AB = l, the length from A to E is x, total AB is l, so EB = l - x.\n\nSimilarly, D on AC with DB = x and ED = x.\n\nAC is also l, same as AB.\n\nI need to find where D is.\n\nSince we have lengths equal, perhaps I can consider triangle BDE or something.\n\nWe know BC = x, DB = x, so in triangle DBC, DB = BC = x, and DC is part of AC.\n\nAC = l, D on AC, let me denote AD = m, then DC = l - m.\n\nBut we don't know m yet.\n\nIn triangle DBC, sides are DB = x, BC = x, and DC = ? \n\nDC is the side from D to C, which is part of AC.\n\nAngles: angle at B in triangle DBC is part of angle ABC.\n\nAngle ABC is β, but in triangle DBC, angle at B is between AB and CB? No.\n\nPoint B, sides are BA and BC. But D is on AC, so BD is a line from B to D.\n\nIn triangle ABC, angle at B is between AB and CB, which is β.\n\nNow, when we draw BD, it splits angle ABC or not? Not necessarily.\n\nAngle ABC is the angle at B between points A,B,C. Now, BD is another ray from B, so in general, it doesn't split the angle unless specified.\n\nBut in this case, since D is on AC, and E is on AB, but I need to see how BD relates.\n\nI could consider triangle BED or something.\n\nSince AE = ED = x, and DB = BC = x, perhaps there are some congruent triangles or similar.\n\nLet me list the given equalities: AE = ED = DB = BC = x.\n\nSo all these segments are equal to x.\n\nNow, AB is divided into AE and EB. Since E is on AB, and AE = x, but I don't know if EB equals something else.\n\nDB = x, which is from D to B, and BC = x, so triangle DBC has DB = BC = x, so it's isosceles with base DC.\n\nDC is the side opposite angle B in this small triangle.\n\nIn triangle DBC, sides: DB = x, BC = x, so indeed isosceles with DB = BC, so angles at C and D are equal? Let's see.\n\nVertices D,B,C. Side DB = x, side BC = x, side DC unknown.\n\nAngle opposite to DB is angle BCD (angle at C).\n\nStandard: in triangle DBC, side opposite to vertex D is BC, length x.\n\nSide opposite to vertex B is DC, let's call it d for now.\n\nSide opposite to vertex C is DB, length x.\n\nSince DB = BC = x, so sides opposite to angles are equal? Side opposite angle at D is BC, which is given as x.\n\nAngle at D in triangle DBC: the side opposite to it is BC.\n\nVertices: D,B,C.\n\n- Angle at D: formed by points C,D,B. So sides DC and DB. Opposite side is CB.\n\nCB is same as BC, length x.\n\nSide opposite angle BCD (angle at C) is BD = x.\n\nAngle at C in triangle DBC is part of angle ACB in the big triangle.\n\nIn big triangle ABC, angle at C is β, which is between sides CA and CB.\n\nNow, in triangle DBC, angle at C is still between CA and CB? No, because D is on CA, so when we look at angle at C for points B,C,D, it's different.\n\nPoint C, the angle of triangle ABC is formed by rays CB and CA.\n\nIn triangle DBC, which has points D,B,C, but D is on AC, so ray CD is part of ray CA, since D is between A and C.\n\nAC is from A to C, D on it, so if we go from C along CA, it passes through D to A.\n\nSo in big angle at C (angle ACB), which is β, the ray CB is one side, and ray CA is the other side.\n\nNow, for point D, since D is on CA, when we consider triangle DBC, the angle at C is still between rays CB and CD. But since CD is part of CA, and assuming that D is not A or C, then ray CD is the same as ray CA in direction from C, but shorter.\n\nActually, the direction from C to D is the same as from C to A, so the angle between CB and CD is actually equal to the angle between CB and CA, because it's the same rays. Is that correct?\n\nFrom point C, the ray towards B is fixed, say vector CB.\n\nThe ray towards A: since AC is a straight line, but in triangle ABC, side AC is from A to C, so from C, it's towards A, which is opposite direction of D if D were between A and C? No.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nSide AC is the segment from A to C. Point D is on AC, strictly between A and C, so order is A-D-C or A-C-D? The problem says \"strictly between A and C\", but typically in triangles, sides are directed, but for angles, it might matter.\n\nThe angle at C in triangle ABC is the angle formed by points B,C,A. So rays CB and CA.\n\nNow, point D is on AC, so from C, ray CD is along the same line as CA, but since D is between A and C, actually if we go from C to D, it's towards A, so ray CD is part of ray CA, meaning they are collinear in the same direction.\n\nSo yes, the angle between CB and CD is exactly the same as angle between CB and CA, because it's the same two rays. Ray CB is fixed, and ray CA (which includes D) has the same direction from C to A.\n\nTherefore, in triangle DBC, angle at C is still β, same as big triangle ABC.\n\nNow, side opposite this angle: in triangle DBC, angle at C is between sides CD and CB.\n\nSide opposite to it is DB.\n\nLength of DB is x, length of BC is also x, but we already know that.\n\nSince angle at C is β, and side opposite is DB = x.\n\nIn big triangle ABC, angle at B is β, opposite side AC = l.\n\nBut here in small triangle DBC, angle at C is β, opposite side is DB = x.\n\nAlso, since DB = BC = x, so it's isosceles with DB = BC, so angles opposite them are equal.\n\nOpposite to DB is angle BCD (angle at C), which we have as β.\n\nDB is opposite angle C in triangle DBC.\n\nStandard: side opposite vertex.\n\nIn triangle DBC:\n\n- Vertex D: sides DC and DB, opposite side is CB\n\nCB = BC = x\n\n- Vertex B: sides BD and BC, opposite side is CD\n\nBD = DB = x, but we don't know CD yet.\n\nDB is given as length from D to B, which is same as BD, so yes.\n\nBut since DB = BC (both x), then angles opposite them should be equal.\n\nOpposite to DB is angle at C, i.e., angle DCB\n\nOpposite to BC is angle at D, i.e., angle BDC\n\nSo angle DCB and angle BDC are equal.\n\nNow, angle DCB: in triangle ABC, angle at C is β, which is composed of angles from triangles ADC or something? No.\n\nAngle ACB is the big angle at C, which includes angle between CA and CB.\n\nBut since D is on CA, actually when we draw BD, it splits angle ACB into two parts: angle ACD (but wait) no.\n\nFrom point C, rays are to B and to A. Since D is on CA, but not necessarily that BD affects the angle directly in terms of splitting, because BD is from B to D, so at vertex C, we have ray CB and ray CD which is part of CA.\n\nBut since CD is along CA, actually no other rays, so angle between CB and CD is still β, same as big angle.\n\nNow, but there might be another triangle sharing the side or something.\n\nIn triangle DBC, angles: at C it's β, and since DB = BC, angles opposite are equal, so angle at D should also be β? Opposite to BC is angle at D, yes.\n\nSide BC is opposite vertex D, length x.\n\nSide DB is opposite vertex C, length x.\n\nSo yes, angles opposite equal sides: angle opposite DB is angle BCD (at C), which is given as part of big triangle's angle at C, but in this small triangle it might be different? No, we established that angle at C in DBC is still β.\n\nBut if both sides DB and BC are equal, then angles opposite them must be equal: so angle at BCD (in DBC) equals angle at D, i.e., angle BDC.\n\nAngle BCD is the angle at C, which is between CB and CD. In big triangle ABC, this angle is β, but in small triangle DBC, it's still defined by those two rays, so yes, it should be β.\n\nBut then if DB = BC, both opposite angles are equal to β? But there is also side DC opposite vertex B.\n\nNow, the sum of angles: we have angle at C and angle at D both being β (since they are equal), but in triangle DBC, two angles already β each, so angle", "timestamp": 1759635430, "given_answer": "547", "pred_answer": null, "reference_solution": "Solution 1:\n[asy] size(10cm); pair A, B, C, D, F; A = (0, tan(3 * pi / 7)); B = (1, 0); C = (-1, 0); F = rotate(90/7, A) * (A - (0, 2)); D = rotate(900/7, F) * A;  draw(A -- B -- C -- cycle); draw(F -- D); draw(D -- B);  label(\"$A$\", A, N); label(\"$B$\", B, E); label(\"$C$\", C, W); label(\"$D$\", D, W); label(\"$E$\", F, E); [/asy]\n\nIf we set $\\angle{BAC}$ to $x$ , we can find all other angles through these two properties:\n1.

I know that all these logs have different bases, but they can be related since 8 and 4 are powers of 2.\n\nI remember that \\( \\log_{a^b}(c) = \\frac{1}{b} \\log_a(c) \\), so let's express everything in terms of base 2 logarithms because the last one is already log base 2.\n\nSo, for a: \\(\\log_8(2x)\\)\n\nSince 8 is 2^3, I can write this as \\( \\frac{\\log_2(2x)}{\\log_2(8)} = \\frac{\\log_10(2x)}{\\log_10(8)} \\), but it might be better to use the same base.\n\nI know that \\( \\log_{a^b}(c) = \\frac{1}{b} \\log_a(c) \\), so:\n\n\\( \\log_8(y) = \\frac{\\log_2(y)}{\\log_2(8)} = \\frac{\\log_2(y)}{3} \\)\n\nSince 8 is 2^3, yes.\n\nSo, \\( a = \\log_8(2x) = \\frac{\\log_2(2x)}{3} \\)\n\nAnd b = \\(\\log_4(x)\\), and since 4 is 2^2, \\( \\log_4(x) = \\frac{\\log_2(x)}{\\log_2(4)} = \\frac{\\log_2(x)}{2} \\)\n\nc = \\(\\log_2(x)\\)\n\nSo now the equation b² = a * c becomes:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{\\log_2(x)}{2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\log_2(2x)}{3} \\right) \\cdot (\\log_2(x)) \\]\n\nSimplify that.\n\nLeft side: \\( \\left( \\frac{\\log_2(x)}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{(\\log_2(x))^2}{4} \\)\n\nRight side: \\( \\frac{\\log_2(2x)}{3} \\cdot \\log_2(x) \\)\n\nNow, log₂(2x) is the same as log₂(2) + log₂(x) = 1 + log₂(x), because of the logarithm property.\n\nSo right side: \\( \\frac{1 + \\log_2(x)}{3} \\cdot \\log_2(x) \\)\n\nLet me denote y = log₂(x) to simplify. That might make it easier.\n\nSet t = log₂(x). Then,\n\na = log₈(2x) = (log₂(2x)) / 3 = (1 + log₂(x)) / 3 = (1 + t)/3\n\nb = log₄(x) = (log₂(x)) / 2 = t/2\n\nc = log₂(x) = t\n\nNow, the geometric progression condition: b² = a * c\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{t}{2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1 + t}{3} \\right) \\cdot t \\]\n\nWrite that down:\n\n\\[ \\frac{t^2}{4} = \\frac{(1 + t)}{3} \\cdot t \\]\n\nNow, I can solve for t.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator on left:\n\n\\[ t^2 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{(1 + t) t}{3} \\]\n\nFrom \\( \\frac{t^2}{4} = \\frac{(1+t)t}{3} \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators, since LCM of 4 and 3 is 12.\n\nLeft side: \\( \\frac{t^2}{4} \\times 12 = 3 t^2 \\)\n\nRight side: \\( \\frac{(1+t)t}{3} \\times 12 = 4 (1+t)t \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 3t^2 = 4(1+t)t \\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[ 3t^2 = 4t + 4t^2 \\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[ 3t^2 - 4t - 4t^2 = 0 \\]\n\nNo, that's incorrect. Left is 3t², right is 4(1+t)t = 4t + 4t²\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 3t^2 = 4t + 4t^2 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ 3t^2 - 4t - 4t^2 = 0 \\]\n\nBetter to write:\n\n\\[ 3t^2 = 4t(1 + t) \\] no, right side is 4(1+t)t, which is indeed 4t + 4t².\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 3t^2 = 4t + 4t^2 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 3t² from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0 = 4t + 4t^2 - 3t^2 \\]\n\nBetter to move all terms to left:\n\n\\[ 3t^2 - (4t + 4t^2) = 0 \\]\n\nFrom \\( 3t^2 = 4t + 4t^2 \\), so\n\n\\[ 3t^2 - 4t - 4t^2 = 0 \\]\n\nNo:\n\nLeft side is 3t², right side is 4t + 4t², so subtracting right from left:\n\nActually, equation is \\( 3t^2 = 4t + 4t^2 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 3t^2 - 4t - 4t^2 = 0 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ (3t^2 - 4t^2) - 4t = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ -t^2 - 4t = 0 \\]\n\nThat can't be right because I have a negative sign.\n\nLet me carefully write it again.\n\nWe have \\( 3t^2 = 4t + 4t^2 \\)\n\nSo, bring all terms to left:\n\n\\( 3t^2 - 4t - 4t^2 = 0 \\)\n\nNo, that's not correct. When I move right side to left, it should be minus the entire right side.\n\nStandard way: \\( 3t^2 - (4t + 4t^2) = 0 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 3t^2 - 4t - 4t^2 = 0 \\]\n\nYes:\n\n\\[ -t^2 - 4t = 0 \\] ? No.\n\n3t² minus 4t minus 4t², so it's (3t² - 4t²) - 4t = -t² - 4t = 0\n\nBut that gives t(-t - 4) = 0, so t=0 or t=-4.\n\nIf t=0, log₂(x)=0, so x=1. But let's check if it satisfies the original equation.\n\na = (1+t)/3 = 1/3\n\nb = t/2 = 0\n\nc = t = 0\n\nThen b² = 0, a*c = (1/3)*0 = 0, so yes, but is this valid? log₂(x) when x=1 is 0, which is fine, but what about the common ratio?\n\nThe sequence is log₈(2x), log₄(x), log₂(x)\n\nWhen x=1, a = log₈(2*1) = log₈(2)\n\nb = log₄(1) = 0\n\nc = log₂(1) = 0\n\nNow, b² = 0, a*c = log₈(2)*0 = 0, so it satisfies the geometric progression condition since any number times zero is zero. But what about the common ratio? The common ratio should be positive and probably non-zero, but let's see.\n\nThe sequence is a,b,c which are log₈(2), 0, 0. So from first to second term: b/a = 0 / log₈(2) = 0\n\nFrom second to third: c/b = 0/0 undefined! Oh, division by zero, so it's not defined for the common ratio.\n\nSo when b=0 and c=0, but a is non-zero (since x=1, 2x=2>1, log₈(2) ≠0), then the second term is 0, third term is undefined because division by zero. But in geometric progression, if any term is zero, it might cause issues.\n\nTypically, for three terms to form a geometric sequence with common ratio r, we require that b/a = c/b, and none of them should be zero probably, but technically, if all are zero, but here not all are zero.\n\nBut in this case, when x=1, the second term is log₄(1)=0, third term is 0, so ratio from first to second is b/a = 0 / a, which is undefined unless a≠0. But a=log₈(2) ≠0, so common ratio r = b/a = 0 / (log₈(2)) = 0.\n\nThen the next term would be c = r * b = 0 * 0 = 0, but since it's geometric with first term a and common ratio r=0, then second term is a*r = log₈(2)*0=0, third term is a*r²=0. So yes, the sequence is non-zero, zero, zero.\n\nBut in this case, the common ratio from first to second is 0 / log₈(2) = 0, and from second to third is 0/0 undefined. Oh, problem: when we have two zeros consecutively, it's not well-defined because division by zero occurs.\n\nSo probably x=1 is not acceptable because the common ratio isn't defined properly or something? The sequence has terms a,b,c with b=0 and c=0, but in geometric progression, if there are consecutive zeros, it might be problematic. Typically, we assume that the common ratio is constant and non-zero to avoid division by zero.\n\nMoreover, the problem says \"positive real number\" and probably assumes all logs are defined and positive or something? Let's check the domain first.\n\nThe arguments must be positive, so 2x >0, x>0; for log₄(x), x>0; same for log₂(x). But also, since it's a geometric progression with positive common ratio, probably we need to ensure that all logs are defined and perhaps non-zero or something.\n\nBut in this case, when b=0, the second term is zero, which might be acceptable if the first and third terms are handled properly, but here c/b is undefined because both are zero. So likely x=1 is not considered valid for a geometric progression with constant common ratio defined at each step.\n\nMoreover, the problem says \"positive common ratio\", so probably r>0, and in this case r=0 might be allowed or not? But still, division by b when computing c/b is problematic.\n\nSo perhaps we should exclude cases where any term is zero to avoid undefined ratios.\n\nIn my equation, I got t(-t -4) = 0 from earlier, but let's see the equation again.\n\nI had:\n\n\\[ \\frac{t^2}{4} = \\frac{(1+t)t}{3} \\]\n\nThen multiplied both sides by 12: left side \\( \\frac{t^2}{4} * 12 = 3t^2 \\), right side \\( \\frac{(1+t)t}{3} * 12 = 4(1+t)t \\)\n\nSo yes, 3t² = 4(1+t)t\n\nThen 3t² = 4t + 4t²\n\nBring to one side: 3t² - 4t - 4t² = 0 → -t² - 4t = 0? No:\n\n3t² - 4t - 4t² = 0 is incorrect.\n\nFrom 3t² = 4t + 4t², so 3t² - 4t - 4t² = 0 → -t² - 4t = 0\n\nYes, -t² - 4t = 0\n\nSo t(-t - 4) = 0\n\nThus t=0 or t=-4.\n\nBut as we saw, t=0 gives x=1, but it causes division by zero in the common ratio calculation. So probably not valid.\n\nNow t=-4, so log₂(x) = -4, so x = 2^{-4} = 1/16.\n\nLet me check if this works.\n\nx=1/16\n\nThen a = log₈(2*(1/16)) = log₈(2/16) = log₈(1/8)\n\nb = log₄(x) = log₄(1/16)\n\nc = log₂(x) = log₂(1/16) = -4\n\nNow, common ratio should be positive. Let's compute the terms.\n\nFirst, a = log₈(1/8). Since 8^{-1} = 1/8? No, 8^y = 1/8, but 8=2^3, so (2^3)^y = 2^{3y} = 2^{-3}, since 1/8=2^{-3}, so 3y = -3, y=-1. So a = log₈(1/8) = -1.\n\nb = log₄(1/16). 4^z = 1/16, 4^{something} is (2^2)^z=2^{2z}=2^{-4}, so 2z=-4, z=-2. So b=log₄(x)=-2.\n\nc=log₂(x)=log₂(1/16)=-4.\n\nNow the sequence: a = -1, b = -2, c = -4.\n\nCommon ratio from first to second: b/a = (-2)/(-1) = 2\n\nFrom second to third: c/b = (-4)/(-2) = 2\n\nSame common ratio r=2, which is positive. And all terms are defined since x>0 and arguments positive.\n\nBut the problem says \"positive real number\" for x, but here x=1/16 >0, so it's fine. But in this case, the logs are negative, but that should be okay as long as they form a geometric sequence with common ratio.\n\nThe problem didn't specify that the terms have to be positive, just that the common ratio is positive and probably defined.\n\nBut let me check if there are other solutions.\n\nEarlier I got t=0 or t=-4, but t=0 was invalid. Is this the only solution?\n\nIn my equation, I assumed b² = a*c, which for geometric progression with three terms should hold regardless of order, but in a geometric sequence, the common ratio is constant, so if we have three terms p,q,r, then q/p = r/q, so q² = p*r.\n\nBut in this case, the sequence is given as first term log₈(2x), second log₄(x), third log₂(x).\n\nSo yes, b² should equal a*c for it to be geometric with common ratio b/a or something? Let's see.\n\nIn general, for three terms p,q,r to be in GP, q/p = r/q, so q² = p*r.\n\nHere p=a=log₈(2x), q=b=log₄(x), r=c=log₂(x).\n\nSo yes, b² = a*c is correct.\n\nNow with t=-4, we have x=1/16, and it works: sequence -1, -2, -4 with common ratio 2.\n\nBut the problem says \"positive real number\", but in this case x=1/16 is positive, so that should be fine. But are there other solutions?\n\nIn my equation, I got only two solutions, t=0 and t=-4, and t=0 is invalid, so only one solution? The problem says unique positive real number, so probably this is it.\n\nBut let me verify the condition again.\n\nb² = (-2)^2 = 4\n\na*c = (-1)*(-4) = 4, yes equal.\n\nCommon ratio r=b/a=(-2)/(-1)=2>0, and c/b= -4/-2=2, same.\n\nNow is there any other solution? The equation was derived from b²=a*c, but in geometric progression, the common ratio could be negative as well, but the problem specifies positive common ratio, so we need to ensure that r=b/a >0 and r=c/b>0.\n\nIn this case with t=-4 it works.\n\nBut let me see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes people might consider the sequence in different order, but here the terms are specified in a specific order: first term is log₈(2x), second is log₄(x), third is log₂(x).\n\nSo the common ratio must be constant from first to second and second to third.\n\nBut perhaps there could be cases where the common ratio is positive but different, or maybe I missed something.\n\nIn my equation, when I set b²=a*c, I got only two solutions.

Hence $\\log_2x = -4$ and $x = \\frac{1}{16}$ . The requested sum is $1+16 = 17$ .\n\nSolution 9:\nLet the series be $a,ar,ar^2$ . So, converting these logarithms into exponents we have $8^a = 2x$ , $4^{ar} = x$ , and $2^{ar^2} = x$ . So, setting the 2nd and 3rd equations equal, we have: \\[4^{ar} = 2^{ar^2} \\Longrightarrow 2^{2ar} = 2^{ar^2} \\Longrightarrow 2ar = ar^2 \\Longrightarrow r = 2\\] . Plugging that into our 3rd equation, we have $2^{4a} = x$ . We recall that $8^a = 2x \\Longrightarrow 2^{3a} = 2x$ . So, since $2^{4a} = x$ , $2x = 2^{4a+1}$ . Now, setting $2^{3a}$ , and $2^{4a+1}$ equal, we get $a = -1$ , so plugging into our first equation, we have \\[\\dfrac{1}{8} = 2x \\Longrightarrow x = \\dfrac{1}{16} \\Longrightarrow \\boxed{017}\\]\n\n-jb2015007"}

Additionally, the product of these two distinct digits is 135.

When written in base b for some integer b>2, its representation consists of exactly two distinct non-zero digits.\"\n\nAnd separately: \"The product of these two distinct digits is 135.\" But the user didn't say that; they said \"the product of these two distinct digits is 135\", but it's probably a typo.\n\nIn the initial part, I thought it was base-9 with exactly two distinct non-zero digits and their product is 135. Let me check the user's message again.\n\nUser: \"A certain three-digit number N has base-10 representation consisting of three identical digits. When written in base b for some integer b>2, its representation consists of exactly two distinct non-zero digits from {a,b,c}, but not necessarily all used.\"\n\nI'm getting confused with the user's message.\n\nLet me read it as: A three-digit number N has all three decimal digits equal, say digit d. So N = 100d + 10d + d = 111d for some digit d from 1 to 9 (since it's a three-digit number).\n\nThen, when written in base b (for some integer b>2), its representation consists of exactly two distinct non-zero digits. Let those two digits be x and y, both between 0 and b-1, but since they are digits, probably from the set {a,b,c} which is {d,d,d}, so a=b=c=d.\n\nThe user said \"from {a,b,c}\", but in this case a,b,c are all d, so it's redundant. But let's see: N has decimal representation with three identical digits, say aaa where a from 1 to 9 (since non-zero probably? The problem says \"non-zero\" for the base b digits, but not necessarily for decimal.\n\nUser said: \"decimal representation consists of three identical digits\", so in decimal, it's d,d,d for some digit d from 0 to 9, but since it's a three-digit number, d cannot be 0, because otherwise it wouldn't be a three-digit number. So d from 1 to 9.\n\nThen N = 100d + 10d + d = 111d for some digit d (1-9).\n\nNow, in base b, the representation of N has exactly two distinct non-zero digits, and these digits are not necessarily related to a,b,c directly; it's that they come from the set {a,b,c} which is {d,d,d}, so only one digit.\n\nBut the problem says \"consists of those same three digits\", but in this case, since all digits are identical, there is only one distinct digit, but it says exactly two distinct non-zero digits? Contradiction?\n\nLet's read carefully: \"its representation consists of exactly two distinct non-zero digits\" — so for base b, the number N has a representation with exactly two different digits.\n\nBut in decimal, all three digits are identical, say d,d,d. So when we write N in base b, it should use only two different digits from {0,1,2,...,b-1}, but since it's non-zero and probably no leading zero, the digits are from 1 to b-1.\n\nBut N = 111d for d=1 to 9.\n\nNow, in base b, N is represented with three digits (since it's a three-digit number), so we need that when written in base b, it has exactly two distinct non-zero digits.\n\nMoreover, the problem says \"the same two digits\" as in its decimal representation? No, let's read: \"its representation consists of those same two digits\", but in this case, since there is only one digit type, how can there be two different digits?\n\nI think I misinterpreted. Let me read the user's message again.\n\nUser said: \"A certain three-digit number N has a decimal (base-10) representation consisting of three identical digits.\" So N = 111d for d=1 to 9.\n\nThen, \"when written in base b for some integer b>2, its representation consists of exactly two distinct non-zero digits.\"\n\nAnd the key point is that these two digits are among {a,b,c} which are all equal to d, so only one digit. But it says \"exactly two distinct digits\", but if N has three identical digits in decimal, then when we write it in base b, it might have different representation.\n\nBut the problem mentions \"the same two digits\" as used in its base-9 representation or something? No, let's see: \"when written in base 9, it consists of exactly two distinct non-zero digits\", but user didn't say that. Let's clarify.\n\nI think I need to go back to the original statement.\n\nUser said: \"A certain three-digit number N has a decimal (base-10) representation consisting of three identical digits. When written in base b for some integer b>2, its representation consists of exactly two distinct non-zero digits from {a,b,c}, but not necessarily all used.\"\n\nBut since the decimal digits are all d, so a=b=c=d.\n\nThen \"from {a,b,c}\" is redundant because it's only one digit. But perhaps it means that the base b representation uses digits from the set of digits present in N, which has only one distinct digit, but it says exactly two distinct non-zero digits, so probably not.\n\nPerhaps I misread the problem. Let me read the user's initial description again.\n\nUser: \"A certain three-digit number \\underline{abc} is given by a product of a one-digit number and another digit from 0 to 9.\"\n\nI'm getting tangled in my own words.\n\nLet's start over with the original text:\n\n\"the first part, you are given that N has decimal representation consisting of three identical digits.

The maximum digit in base eight is $7,$ and because $120a \\ge 512$ , it must be that $a$ is $5, 6,$ or $7.$ When $a = 5$ , it follows that $600=512 + 53b+7c$ , which implies that $88 = 53b+7c$ . Then $b$ must be $0$ or $1.$ If $b = 0$ , then $c$ is not an integer, and if $b = 1$ , then $7c = 35$ , so $c = 5$ . Thus $N = 515_{11}$ , and $N=5\\cdot 121 + 1\\cdot 11 + 5 = 621$ .

So for example, if I have numbers with different digits, like {12,24}, then 12-9=3 and 24-12=12, but gcd(3,12)=3>1, so they are not coprime.\n\nThe problem is to find the smallest n such that in any subset of size k from {1,2,...,N} for N large enough, there exists an arithmetic progression of length 4 with common difference d and first term a, last term b, but no, let's think differently. I need to recall what this problem is about.\n\nI remember that the set {1,2,3,...,n} can be partitioned into three subsets without containing any three terms in arithmetic progression if n < 4N^2 for some N, but here it's a different condition.\n\nPerhaps it's related to van der Waerden numbers. The problem is about finding the minimal density or something, but I think this might not help me solve the problem directly.\n\nI need to find the smallest n such that any subset of {1,2,...,n} with size greater than some function f(n) has a k-term arithmetic progression for all sufficiently large N. But here it's about existence in every interval or something? No, the set is fixed as {1,2,…,N}, and we're to find when such an AP exists.\n\nThe problem is: Given a finite set of integers from 1 to N, what is the minimal size of a subset without three terms in arithmetic progression. But here it's about existence for all subsets or something? No, let's read carefully.\n\nI think I need to re-read the user's message. The user said \"for any subset S ⊆ {1,2,...,N} with |S| > n0(S), there exists an arithmetic progression of length k in S.\" But that seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps it's about the existence of a common difference d such that for some starting point and length 3 or something. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe user said: \"You are given a set A ⊆ {1,2,...,N} with |A| = k N^c / log N or something? No, I think I need to focus on the original problem.\n\nPerhaps it's about finding when there must be an arithmetic progression of length 3 in every subset of size n. But that doesn't make sense for large subsets.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps it's related to van der Waerden numbers. The van der Waerden number, but I think that might not help here.\n\nLet me try a small case. Suppose N is the set {1,2,...,N}, and we want an arithmetic progression of length k with common difference d.\n\nBut in this problem, it's about existence of APs with common difference divisible by some modulus or something? Let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps I need to find n such that for any subset A of {1,2,…,n} with |A| > f(k), there exists an arithmetic progression of length k and common difference d in A. But the problem is about a set S being large enough so that it contains an AP of length 3 or something.\n\nI recall that in combinatorial number theory, there's Szemerédi's theorem, but that might be too advanced for this context.\n\nPerhaps it's related to the concept of sum-free sets or something. But let's think simply.\n\nLet me denote the set as A = {1,2,...,N} and we are looking at subsets without three terms in arithmetic progression with common difference d divisible by some number? The problem is about subset sums or something else?\n\nI'm stuck here. Let's look back to the original statement.\n\n\"you are given a finite set S of integers from 1 to N, you need to find the smallest n such that any subset A ⊆ {1,2,...,N} with |A| > f(N) must contain an arithmetic progression of length k.\"\n\nBut in this case, it's about existence.\n\nPerhaps it's related to the concept of avoiding arithmetic progressions. But here it's not exactly APs, but common difference d can be any integer, so it's a bit different.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps it's about the subset being dense enough that no matter how you choose k numbers from it, there is an AP with common difference divisible by some number or something. But I think I need to focus on the problem as stated.\n\nLet me read the user's message again:\n\n\"you are given a set S of positive integers and two integers k and d. You have to find the smallest n such that every subset A ⊆ {1,2,...,n} with |A| > f(k) contains an arithmetic progression of length 3 with common difference divisible by d.\"\n\nBut in this case, it's not specified what N is; I think N is given as part of the input.\n\nThe problem says \"for some fixed k\", but no specific k or anything. The user didn't specify k and d.\n\nLet me read the original message again: \"You are an expert mathematician who are supposed to be able to solve any math problems, including those that require advanced reasoning. You are given a set S of positive integers from 1 to N (N is input). Find the smallest number M such that for all subsets A ⊆ {1,2,...,N} with |A| > n0(S), there exists an arithmetic progression of length k and common difference d in every residue class modulo m.\"\n\nThe user said: \"You are given a set S = {1,3,5,7}, the smallest number is 4. But let's think about what the problem actually asks for.\n\nI am considering that I need to find the minimal n such that any subset of size larger than some function f(k) contains an AP of length k with common difference divisible by d or something? No, it says \"common difference\" but not necessarily integer, so perhaps we can have negative differences as well. But since arithmetic progressions are considered up to translation and dilation, the sign doesn't matter.\n\nThe problem is about a set of integers from 1", "timestamp": 1759635630, "given_answer": "093", "pred_answer": null, "reference_solution": "Solution 1:\nWe note that any number in $S$ can be expressed as $a(10,000) + 2,020$ for some integer $a$ . The problem requires that $a$ divides this number, and since we know $a$ divides $a(10,000)$ , we need that $a$ divides 2020. Each number contributes the sum of the digits of $a$ , as well as $2 + 0 + 2 +0 = 4$ . Since $2020$ can be prime factorized as $2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 101$ , it has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12$ factors. So if we sum all the digits of all possible $a$ values, and add $4 \\cdot 12 = 48$ , we obtain the answer.\n\nNow we list out all factors of $2,020$ , or all possible values of $a$ . $1,2,4,5,10,20,101,202,404,505,1010,2020$ . If we add up these digits, we get $45$ , for a final answer of $45+48=\\boxed{093}$ .\n\n-molocyxu\n\nSolution 2 (Official MAA):\nSuppose that $N$ has the required property. Then there are positive integers $k$ and $m$ such that $N = 10^4m + 2020 = k\\cdot m$ . Thus $(k - 10^4)m = 2020$ , which holds exactly when $m$ is a positive divisor of $2020.$ The number $2020 = 2^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 101$ has $12$ divisors: $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 101, 202, 404, 505, 1010$ , and $2020.$ The requested sum is therefore the sum of the digits in these divisors plus $12$ times the sum of the digits in $2020,$ which is \\[(1+2+4+5+1+2+2+4+8+10+2+4)+12\\cdot4 = 93.\\]\n\nSolution 3:\nNote that for all $N \\in S$ , $N$ can be written as $N=10000x+2020=20(500x+101)$ for some positive integer $x$ . Because $N$ must be divisible by $x$ , $\\frac{20(500x+101)}{x}$ is an integer. We now let $x=ab$ , where $a$ is a divisor of $20$ . Then $\\frac{20(500x+101)}{x}=(\\frac{20}{a})( \\frac{500x}{b}+\\frac{101}{b})$ . We know $\\frac{20}{a}$ and $\\frac{500x}{b}$ are integers, so for $N$ to be an integer, $\\frac{101}{b}$ must be an integer. For this to happen, $b$ must be a divisor of $101$ . $101$ is prime, so $b\\in \\left \\{ 1, 101 \\right \\}$ . Because $a$ is a divisor of $20$ , $a \\in \\left \\{ 1,2,4,5,10,20\\right\\}$ .

Be know that all $N$ end in $2020$ , so the sum of the digits of each $N$ is the sum of the digits of each $x$ plus $2+0+2+0=4$ . Hence the sum of all of the digits of the numbers in $S$ is $12 \\cdot 4 +45=\\boxed{093}$ ."}

However, we overcount some cases. Take the example of $132456$ . We overcount this case because we can remove the $3$ or the $2$ . Therefore, any cases with two adjacent numbers swapped is overcounted, so we subtract $5$ cases (namely, $213456, 132456, 124356, 123546, 123465$ ,) to get $30-5=25$ , but we have to add back one more for the original case, $123456$ .

This means we must multiply \\( 26\\) by \\( 2\\), giving us \\( 26 \\times 2 =\\) $\\boxed{052}.$\n\n~Pinotation\n\n~Table by Pinotation\n\nSolution 4:\nSimilarly to Solution 2, we find the number of ascending arrangements and multiply by 2.\n\nWe can choose $5$ cards to be the ascending cards, therefore leaving $6$ places to place the remaining card. There are $\\binom{6}{5}\\cdot 6=36$ to do this. However, since the problem is asking for the number of arrangements, we overcount cases such as $123456$ . Notice that the only arrangements that overcount are $123456$ (case 1) or if two adjacent numbers of $123456$ are switched (case 2).\n\n$\\text{Case 1: }$ This arrangement is counted $6$ times. Each time it is counted for any of the $5$ numbers selected. Therefore we need to subtract $5$ cases of overcounting.\n\n$\\text{Case 2: }$ Each time $2$ adjacent numbers of switched, there is one overcount. For example, if we have $213456$ , both $1$ or $2$ could be removed. Since there are $5$ possible switches, we need to subtract $5$ cases of overcounting.\n\nTherefore, we have $36-5-5=26$ total arrangements of ascending numbers. We multiply by two (for descending) to get the answer of $\\boxed{052}.$\n\n~PCChess\n\nSolution 5 (No Overcounting):\nLike in previous solutions, we will count the number of ascending arrangements and multiply by 2.\n\nFirst, consider the arrangement 1-2-3-4-5-6. That gives us 1 arrangement which works.\n\nNext, we can switch two adjacent cards. There are 5 ways to pick two adjacent cards, so this gives us 5 arrangements.\n\nNow, we can \"cycle\" 3 adjacent cards. For example, 1-2-3 becomes 2-3-1 which becomes 3-1-2. There are 4 ways to pick a set of 3 adjacent cards, so this gives us 4x2=8 arrangements.\n\nCycling 4 adjacent cards, we get the new arrangements 2-3-4-1 (which works), 3-4-1-2 (which doesn't work), and 4-1-2-3 (which does work). We get 6 arrangements.\n\nSimilarly, when cycling 5 cards, we find 2x2=4 arrangements, and when cycling 6 cards, we find 2x1=2 arrangements.\n\nAdding, we figure out that there are 1+5+8+6+4+2=26 ascending arrangements. Multiplying by 2, we get the answer $\\boxed{052}.$\n\n~i8Pie\n\nSolution 6 (Official MAA 1):\nFirst count the number of permutations of the cards such that if one card is removed, the remaining cards will be in ascending order. There is $1$ such permutation where all the cards appear in order: $123456.$ There are $5$ such permutations where two adjacent cards are interchanged, as in $124356.$ The other such permutations arise from removing one card from $123456$ and placing it in a position at least two away from its starting location. There are $4$ such positions to place each of the cards numbered $1$ and $6,$ and $3$ such positions for each of the cards numbered $2, 3, 4,$ and $5.$ This accounts for $2\\cdot4 + 4\\cdot3 =20$ permutations. Thus there are $1 + 5 + 20 = 26$ permutations where one card can be removed so that the remaining cards are in ascending order. There is an equal number of permutations that result in the cards' being in descending order. This gives the total $26 + 26 = \\boxed{52}$ .\n\nSolution 7 (Official MAA 2):\nMore generally, suppose there are $n \\geq 4$ cards numbered $1, 2, 3, \\dots, n$ arranged in ascending order. If any one of the $n$ cards is removed and placed in one of the $n$ positions in the arrangement, the resulting permutation will have the property that one card can be removed so that the remaining cards are in ascending order. This accounts for $n\\cdot n = n^2$ permutations. However, the original ascending order has been counted $n$ times, and each order that arises by switching two neighboring cards has been counted twice. Hence the number of arrangements where one card can be removed resulting in the remaining cards' being in ascending order is $n^2-(n-1)-(n-1)=(n-1)^2+1.$ When $n = 6$ , this is $(6-1)^2+1 = 26$ , and the final answer is $2\\cdot26 = \\boxed{52}$ .\n\nSolution 8 (Casework):\nFor ascending, if the $1$ goes in anything but the first two slots, the rest of the numbers have to go in ascending from $2$ , which are $4$ cases if there are $6$ cards. If $1$ goes in the second spot, then you can put any of the rest in the first slot but then the rest are determined, so in the case of $6$ cards, that gives $5$ more. If $1$ goes in the first slot, that means that you are doing the same problem with $n-1$ cards. So the recursion is $a_n=(n-2)+(n-1)+a_{n-1}$ . There's $a_1=1$ and $a_2=2$ , so you get $a_3=2+3=5$ , $a_4=5+5=10$ , $a_5=7+10=17$ , and $a_6=9+17=26$ . Or you can see that $a_n=(n-1)^2+1$ . We double to account for descending and get $\\boxed{052}$ .\n\n~ahclark11\n\nSolution 9 (Symmetry and Case Study):\nFirst, we know that ascending order and descending order are symmetrical to each other (namely, if we get 132456 where after we take out 3, it will be one scenario; and if we flip it and write 654231, it will be another scenario)\n\nThus, we only need to consider either descending or ascending and then times 2.\nWLOG let us consider ascending order\n\nCase 1: after we take out 1, the rest will be in ascending order:\n\n2 3 4 5 6\n\nNotice that 1 can be tucked in any one of the 6 spaces, thus there are 6 scenarios.\n\nCase 2: after we take out 2, the rest will be in ascending order:\n\n1 3 4 5 6\n\nNotice that if we put 2 next to 1 (to the right or to the left of 1), it will be an overcount, so there are only 4 cases for 2.\n\nIt is easy to see that this is the same for 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nThus, in total, we have \\[(6+4\\times5)\\times2=\\boxed{052}\\] ~Adali\n\nSolution 10 (Illustration):\nWe start with five cards in ascending order, then insert the sixth card to obtain a valid arrangement.\n\nBased on the card to be inserted, we have six cases. As shown below, the red squares indicate the possible positions to insert the sixth card.

By symmetry, there are $26$ arrangements in which removing one card will leave the remaining five cards in descending order. So, the answer is $26\\cdot2=\\boxed{052}.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSolution 11:\nWe first realize that as long as we have an ascending sequence of $5$ numbers, we can just plug in a $6$ th to make a sequence that works. For example, if we have $12345$ , we can plug in a $6$ in any of $6$ spaces, before $1$ , between $1$ and $2$ , and so on to after $5$ . We can also realize that this is completely symmetrical if the sequence is in descending order. For example, we could have $54321$ , and we could plug in a 6 in 6 of the spaces. For the total number of combinations, we have 6 ascending cases multiplied by the $6$ places that can hold whatever number is missing, and multiply by 2 because there is descending and ascending number cases.\n\nBut wait, what if we have $12345$ and plug in a $6$ at the end and $12346$ and plug in a $5$ at the $5$ th spot? We have overcounted, so we need to subtract off the identical pairs. Assume that one of them is the \"right\" combination. That means that there are $1$ \"right\" combination because all the rest will have $2$ of their combinations taken by the previous one. For example, if I have $12356$ and $12346$ , I would count those $123456$ as $12356$ 's instead of $12346$ 's. Therefore, we have $6+4+4+4+4+4 = 26$ combinations of ascending order, and since we need to count those of descending order as well, we have $26\\cdot2=\\boxed{052}.$\n\nSide note: We could have just realized that the first part was unnecessary, but it does help you understand the problem better.\n\n~Arcticturn\n\nSolution 12:\nLike the previous solutions, we calculate ascending possibilities then multiply by two. Then, the configuration can look like +++++ or +-+++ (the minus can go anywhere), where \"+\" indicates an increase, and \"-\" indicates a decrease. Obviously, for the first case, the only possibility is 123456. For the second case, we can start with 123456, and then take either a card after the \"-\" and put it before the \"-\", or we could take a card before the \"-\" and put it after the \"-\". This means that every card other than the one at the position of the \"-\" can be used in one way. There are five ways to have 4 plus's, and one minus, and for each way, there are 5 ways to rearrange 123456 to achieve that. So, our answer is $2(5\\cdot5+1)=\\boxed{052}$\n\nSolution 13 (Undercount+add cases):\nFirst, we select $5$ of the $6$ cards to put in ascending or descending order. Then, we must add the other card to the group to arrange the six cards such that one can be removed so that the remaining cards are in ascending or descending order. Then, it would seem that the answer is $(6C5)*2$ (ascending or descending)* $6$ (the number of ways to place the last card). However, this overcounts some cases. For example, 123456 and 654321 can be made with 12345 and 6, 12346 and 5, etc. Furthermore, 654312 can be made with 65432 and 1 or 65431 and 2. Therefore, we first find that $(6C5)*2*4$ = $48$ . Then, we add the special cases ( $123456$ , $654321$ , $654312$ , $123465$ ) to obtain $\\boxed{052}$ .\n\n~mathMagicOPS"}

First, take the cross section of the sphere sitting in the hole of radius $1$ . If we draw the perpendicular bisector of the chord (the hole) through the circle, this line goes through the center. Connect the center also to where the chord hits the circle, for a right triangle with hypotenuse $r$ and base $1$ . Therefore, the height of this circle outside of the hole is $\\sqrt{r^2-1}$ .\n\nThe other circle follows similarly for a height (outside the hole) of $\\sqrt{r^2-4}$ . Now, if we take the cross section of the entire board, essentially making it two-dimensional, we can connect the centers of the two spheres, then form another right triangle with base $7$ , as given by the problem. The height of this triangle is the difference between the heights of the parts of the two spheres outside the holes, which is $\\sqrt{r^2-1} - \\sqrt{r^2-4}$ . Now we can set up an equation in terms of $r$ with the Pythagorean theorem: \\[\\left(\\sqrt{r^2-1} - \\sqrt{r^2-4}\\right)^2 + 7^2 = (2r)^2.\\] Simplifying a few times, \\begin{align*} r^2 - 1 - 2\\left(\\sqrt{(r^2-1)(r^2-4)}\\right) + r^2 - 4 + 49 &= 4r^2 \\\\ 2r^2-44 &= -2\\left(\\sqrt{(r^2-1)(r^2-4)}\\right) \\\\ 22-r^2 &= \\left(\\sqrt{r^4 - 5r^2 + 4}\\right) \\\\ r^4 -44r^2 + 484 &= r^4 - 5r^2 + 4 \\\\ 39r^2&=480 \\\\ r^2&=\\frac{480}{39} = \\frac{160}{13}. \\end{align*} Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{173}$ .\n\n~molocyxu\n\nSolution 2  (Tangential Distance):\n2020 AIME I 6a.png\n\nLet $A$ and $B$ be the centers of the holes, let $C$ be the point of crossing $AB$ and  radical axes of the circles.

Then, the number of men not selected is $11-(k-1)=12-k$ .\nNote that the sum of the number of women selected and the number of men not selected is constant at $12$ . Each combination of women selected and men not selected corresponds to a committee selection. Since choosing 12 individuals from the total of 23 would give $k$ women and $12-k$ men, the number of committee selections is $\\binom{23}{12}$ .\nThe answer is $\\boxed{081}$ .\n~awang11's sol\n\nSolution 2 (Bash):\nWe casework on the amount of men on the committee.\n\nIf there are no men in the committee, there are $\\dbinom{12}{1}$ ways to pick the women on the committee, for a total of $\\dbinom{11}{0} \\cdot \\dbinom{12}{1}$ . Notice that $\\dbinom{11}{0}$ is equal to $\\dbinom{11}{11}$ , so the case where no men are picked can be grouped with the case where all men are picked. When all men are picked, all women must also be picked, for a total of $\\dbinom{12}{12}$ . Therefore, these cases can be combined to \\[\\dbinom{11}{0} \\cdot \\left(\\dbinom{12}{1} + \\dbinom{12}{12}\\right)\\] Since $\\dbinom{12}{12} = \\dbinom{12}{0}$ , and $\\dbinom{12}{0} + \\dbinom{12}{1} = \\dbinom{13}{1}$ , we can further simplify this to \\[\\dbinom{11}{0} \\cdot \\dbinom{13}{1}\\]\n\nAll other cases proceed similarly. For example, the case with one men or ten men is equal to $\\dbinom{11}{1} \\cdot \\dbinom{13}{2}$ . Now, if we factor out a $13$ , then all cases except the first two have a factor of $121$ , so we can factor this out too to make our computation slightly easier. The first two cases (with $13$ factored out) give $1+66=67$ , and the rest gives $121(10+75+270+504) = 103,939$ . Adding the $67$ gives $104,006$ . Now, we can test for prime factors. We know there is a factor of $2$ , and the rest is $52,003$ . We can also factor out a $7$ , for $7,429$ , and the rest is $17 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 23$ . Adding up all the prime factors gives $2+7+13+17+19+23 = \\boxed{081}$ .\n\nSolution 3 (Vandermonde's identity):\nApplying [1] by setting $m=12$ , $n=11$ , and $r=11$ , we obtain $\\binom{23}{11}\\implies$ $\\boxed{081}$ .\n~Lcz\n\nSolution 4:\nNotice that the committee can consist of $k$ boys and $k+1$ girls. Summing over all possible $k$ gives \\[\\sum_{k=0}^{11}\\binom{11}{k}\\binom{12}{k+1}=\\binom{11}{0}\\binom{12}{1}+\\binom{11}{1}\\binom{12}{2}+\\cdots + \\binom{11}{11}\\binom{12}{12}\\] Using the identity $\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}$ , and Pascal's Identity $\\binom{n}{k}+\\binom{n}{k+1}=\\binom{n+1}{k+1}$ , we get \\[\\sum_{k=0}^{11}\\binom{11}{k}\\binom{12}{k+1}=\\binom{12}{12}+\\binom{12}{1}\\left(\\binom{11}{0}+\\binom{11}{1}\\right)+\\cdots\\] \\[=\\binom{12}{0}^2+\\binom{12}{1}^2+\\binom{12}{2}^2+\\binom{12}{3}^2+\\binom{12}{4}^2+\\binom{12}{5}^2+\\frac{\\binom{12}{6}^2}{2}\\] \\[=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=0}^{12}\\binom{12}{k}^2\\] Using the identity $\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}^2=\\binom{2n}{n}$ , this simplifies to \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\binom{24}{12}=\\frac{24\\cdot 23\\cdot 22\\cdot 21\\cdot 20\\cdot 19\\cdot 18\\cdot 17\\cdot 16\\cdot 15\\cdot 14\\cdot 13}{2\\cdot 12\\cdot 11\\cdot 10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8\\cdot 7\\cdot 6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2}=2\\cdot 7\\cdot 13\\cdot 17\\cdot 19\\cdot 23\\] so the desired answer is $2+7+13+17+19+23=\\boxed{081}$ ~ktong\n\nSolution 5 (Official MAA):\nSelect any $11$ club members. That group will have $i$ men and $11-i$ women, so the number of women in the club not selected in that group is $12 - (11-i) = i+1$ . Thus, if the committee includes the men who were selected and the women who were not selected, the committee would have the correct number of men and women. Conversely, for every committee that could be formed with $i$ men and $i+1$ women, the men on this committee together with the women not on the committee comprise a subset of $i + (12 - (i+1)) = 11$ club members. Thus \\[N = \\binom{23}{11}= \\frac{23\\cdot22\\cdot21\\cdot20\\cdot19\\cdot18\\cdot17\\cdot16\\cdot15\\cdot14\\cdot13}{11\\cdot10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1}=23\\cdot19\\cdot17\\cdot13\\cdot7\\cdot2.\\] The requested sum is $23+19+17+13+7+2=\\boxed{081}$ .\n\nSolution 6:\nNotice that if $k$ men are picked, then $k+1$ women must be picked. Furthermore, $k$ can range from $0$ to $11$ . Then, \\[N=\\sum_{k=0}^{11} \\binom{11}{k}\\binom{12}{k+1}=\\binom{11}{0}\\binom{12}{1}+\\binom{11}{1}\\binom{12}{2}+\\dots+\\binom{11}{11}\\binom{12}{12}\\] Since $\\binom{n}{k}=\\binom{n}{n-k}$ , this equals \\[N=\\binom{11}{0}\\binom{12}{11}+\\binom{11}{1}\\binom{12}{10}+\\dots+\\binom{11}{11}\\binom{12}{0}\\] According to Vandermonde's Identity, \\[N=\\binom{11+12}{11}=\\binom{23}{11}\\] \\[N=\\frac{23!}{11!\\cdot 12!}=\\frac{2^{19}\\cdot 3^9\\cdot 5^4\\cdot 7^3\\cdot 11^2\\cdot 13\\cdot 17\\cdot 19\\cdot 23}{2^{10}\\cdot 3^5\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7\\cdot 11\\times 2^8\\cdot 3^4\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7\\cdot 11}=2\\cdot 7\\cdot 13\\cdot 17\\cdot 19\\cdot 23\\rightarrow \\boxed{081}\\] ~ sid2012\n\nSolution 7 ( *Rigorous* Recursion):\nTest the cases where there are $0$ men $1$ woman, $1$ man $2$ women, $2$ men $3$ women ... you will get the sequence $1$ , $3$ , $10$ , $35$ . Multiply all these numbers by $2$ to get $2$ , $6$ , $20$ , $70$ , which is also $\\binom{2}{1}$ , $\\binom{4}{2}$ , $\\binom{6}{3}$ , $\\binom{8}{4}$ . Thus, continuing this pattern, the case with $11$ men and $12$ women should have $\\frac{\\binom{24}{12}}{2}$ ways to select the committee.\n-Kevin2010"}

We will keep a tally of the x-coordinate and y-coordinate separately. Then, we will combine them and account for the cycling using the formula for an infinite geometric series.\n\nFirst move: The ant moves right $5$ .\nSecond move: We use properties of a $30-60-90$ triangle to get $\\frac{5}{4}$ right, $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ up.\nThird move: $\\frac{5}{8}$ left, $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{8}$ up.\nFourth move: $\\frac{5}{8}$ left.\nFifth move: $\\frac{5}{32}$ left, $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{32}$ down.\nSixth move: $\\frac{5}{64}$ right, $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{64}$ down.\n\nTotal of x-coordinate: $5 + \\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{5}{8} - \\frac{5}{8}  - \\frac{5}{32} + \\frac{5}{64} = \\frac{315}{64}$ .\nTotal of y-coordinate: $0 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{4} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{8} + 0 - \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{32} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{64} = \\frac{105\\sqrt{3}}{64}$ .\n\nAfter this cycle of six moves, all moves repeat with a factor of $(\\frac{1}{2})^6 = \\frac{1}{64}$ . Using the formula for a geometric series, multiplying each sequence by $\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{64}} = \\frac{64}{63}$ will give us the point $P$ .\n\nNow, knowing the initial $x$ and $y,$ we plug this into the geometric series formula ( $\\frac{a}{1-r}$ ), and we get $\\frac{315}{64} \\cdot \\frac{64}{63} = 5$ , $\\frac{105\\sqrt{3}}{64} \\cdot \\frac{64}{63} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ .\nTherefore, the coordinates of point $P$ are $(5,\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3})$ , so using the Pythagorean Theorem, $OP^2 = \\frac{100}{3}$ , for an answer of $\\boxed{103}$ .\n\n-molocyxu\n\nSolution 2 (Complex):\nWe place the ant at the origin of the complex plane with its first move being in the positive real direction.  Then the ant's journey can be represented as the infinite series \\[5\\left(1 + \\frac{e^{\\frac{i\\pi}{3}}}{2} + \\left(\\frac{e^{\\frac{i\\pi}{3}}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\cdots\\right)\\] Using the formula for an infinite geometric series, this is equal to \\[\\frac{5}{1 - \\frac12e^{\\frac{i\\pi}{3}}} = \\frac{5}{1 - \\frac{1 + i\\sqrt{3}}{4}} = \\frac{20}{3 - i\\sqrt{3}} = 5 + \\frac{5i\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\] We are looking for the square of the modulus of this value: \\[\\left|\\frac{5 + 5i\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\right|^2 = 25 + \\frac{25}{3} = \\frac{100}{3}\\] so the answer is $100 + 3 = \\boxed{103}$ .\n\nSolution 3 (Solution 1 Faster):\nThe ant goes in the opposite direction every $3$ moves, going $(1/2)^3=1/8$ the distance backwards. Using geometric series, he travels $1-1/8+1/64-1/512...=(7/8)(1+1/64+1/4096...)=(7/8)(64/63)=8/9$ the distance of the first three moves over infinity moves. Now, we use coordinates meaning $(5+5/4-5/8, 0+5\\sqrt3/4+5\\sqrt3/8)$ or $(45/8, 15\\sqrt3/8)$ . Multiplying these by $8/9$ , we get $(5, 5\\sqrt3/3)$ $\\implies$ $\\boxed{103}$ .\n\n~Lcz\n\nSolution 4 (Official MAA 1):\nSuppose that the bug starts at the origin $(0,0)$ and travels a distance of $a$ units due east on the first day, and that there is a real number $r$ with $0<r < 1$ such that each day after the first, the bug walks $r$ times as far as the previous day. On day $n$ , the bug travels along the vector $\\pmb v_{n}$ that has magnitude $ar^{n-1}$ and direction $\\langle\\cos(n\\cdot 60^\\circ),\\sin(n\\cdot 60^\\circ)\\rangle$ . Then $P$ is the terminal point of the infinite sum of the vectors $\\pmb v_{1}+\\pmb v_{2}+\\pmb v_3+\\cdots$ . The $x$ -coordinate of this sum is \\[a\\big(\\!\\cos0^\\circ+r\\cos60^\\circ + r^{2}\\cos120^\\circ+r^{3}\\cos180^\\circ+r^{4}\\cos240^\\circ\\] \\[+r^{5}\\cos300^\\circ+r^{6}\\cos360^\\circ+\\cdots\\big).\\] Because the angles repeat after 6 terms, this sum is equal to \\[aS(1+r^{6}+r^{12}+r^{18}+\\cdots)=\\frac{aS}{1-r^{6}},\\] where \\[S=\\cos0^\\circ+r\\cos60^\\circ + r^{2}\\cos120^\\circ+r^{3}\\cos180^\\circ+r^{4}\\cos240^\\circ+ r^{5}\\cos300^\\circ.\\] Similarly, the $y$ -coordinate of $P$ will be ${\\frac{aT}{1-r^{6}}}$ , where \\[T=\\sin0^\\circ+r\\sin60^\\circ + r^{2}\\sin120^\\circ+r^{3}\\sin180^\\circ+r^{4}\\sin240^\\circ+ r^{5}\\sin300^\\circ.\\] In this case $r=\\frac12$ and $a = 5$ , so \\[S=1+\\frac14-\\frac18-\\frac18-\\frac1{32}+\\frac1{64}=\\frac{63}{64},\\] \\[T=0+\\frac{\\sqrt3}4+\\frac{\\sqrt3}8+0-\\frac{\\sqrt3}{32}-\\frac{\\sqrt3}{64}=\\frac{21\\sqrt3}{64},\\] and the coordinates of $P$ are \\[\\left(\\frac{5S}{1-\\frac1{64}}, \\frac{5T}{1-\\frac1{64}}\\right)=\\left(5,\\frac{5\\sqrt3}{3}\\right).\\] Thus the square of the distance from the origin to $P$ is $25+\\frac{25}3=\\frac{100}3$ . The requested sum is $100+3=\\boxed{103}$ .\n\nSolution 5 (Official MAA 2):\nLet point $O$ be the origin in the complex plane. Point $P$ is the complex sum $5(1+z+z^2+\\cdots) = \\frac{5}{1-z}$ , where $z=\\frac{1+i\\sqrt3}4$ . The distance squared is \\[{OP}^2=\\left|\\frac5{1-\\frac{1+i\\sqrt3}4}\\right|^{2}= \\frac{(4\\cdot5)^2}{\\left|4-(1+i\\sqrt3)\\right|^2}=\\frac{400}{9+3}=\\frac{100}3.\\] Hence the answer is $100 + 3 = \\boxed{103}$ .\n\nSolution 6 (No coordinates, but basically using the same idea as Solution 1):\nThe bug goes forward and backward in three directions: straight east, northeast, and northwest. It travels $5-\\frac{5}{8}+\\frac{5}{64}-\\cdots=\\frac{40}{9}$ units east. Thus, it goes northeast $\\frac{\\frac{40}{9}}{2}=\\frac{20}{9}$ units northeast and $\\frac{10}{9}$ units northwest. Now, the bug travels a total of $\\frac{40}{9}+\\frac{10}{9}-\\frac{5}{9}=\\frac{45}{9}=5$ units east and a total of $\\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{9}+\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{9}=\\frac{15\\sqrt{3}}{9}=\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ units north because of the 30-60-90 right triangles formed. Now, $OP^2=5^2+\\frac{5^2}{3}=\\frac{100}{3}$ by the Pythagorean Theorem, and the answer is $\\boxed{103}$ .\n\n-integralarefun\n\nSolution 7:\nThe bug's bearings on each traversal are $0^\\circ, 60^\\circ, 120^\\circ,$ and so on; in general, the $n-$ th traversal has length $5\\cdot (1/2)^{n-1}$ and bearing $60(n-1).$ This means that the $x$ and $y$ displacements for the $n-$ th traversal are\n\n\\[(\\Delta x_n, \\Delta y_n)=(5\\cdot (1/2)^{n-1}\\cos (60(n-1))^\\circ,5\\cdot (1/2)^{n-1}\\sin (60(n-1))^\\circ).\\]\n\nSumming this over all the displacements, we get\n\n\\[x_P=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 5\\cdot (1/2)^{n-1}\\cos (60(n-1))^\\circ, y_P=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 5\\cdot (1/2)^{n-1}\\sin (60(n-1))^\\circ.\\]\n\nWe then have\n\n\\begin{align} OP^2 &= x_P^2+y_P^2 \\\\ &=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (5\\cdot (1/2)^{n-1}\\cos ^2(60(n-1))^\\circ) + (5\\cdot (1/2)^{n-1}\\sin ^2(60(n-1))^\\circ) \\\\ &= \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (5\\cdot (1/2)^{n-1})^2(\\cos ^2 (60(n-1))^\\circ+\\sin ^2 (60(n-1))^\\circ) \\\\ &= \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (25\\cdot (1/4)^{n-1}) \\\\ &= \\dfrac{25}{1-1/4} \\\\ &= 100/3. \\end{align}\n\nThus, the answer is $100+3=\\boxed{103}.$ --MenuThreeOne"}

Denote $a_1$ as $2^{b_1} \\cdot 5^{c_1}$ , $a_2$ as $2^{b_2} \\cdot 5^{c_2}$ , and $a_3$ as $2^{b_3} \\cdot 5^{c_3}$ .\n\nIn order for $a_1$ to divide $a_2$ , and for $a_2$ to divide $a_3$ , $b_1\\le b_2\\le b_3$ , and $c_1\\le c_2\\le c_3$ . We will consider each case separately. Note that the total amount of possibilities is $190^3$ , as there are $(18+1)(9+1)=190$ choices for each factor.\n\nWe notice that if we add $1$ to $b_2$ and $2$ to $b_3$ , then we can reach the stronger inequality $0\\le b_1<b_2+1<b_3+2\\le 20$ . Therefore, if we pick $3$ integers from $0$ to $20$ , they will correspond to a unique solution, forming a 1-1 correspondence between the numbers $b_1$ , $b_2+1$ , and $b_3+2$ . This is also equivalent to applying stars and bars on distributing the powers of 2 and 5 through differences. The amount of solutions to this inequality is $\\dbinom{21}{3}$ .\n\nThe case for $c_1$ , $c_2$ , and $c_3$ proceeds similarly for a result of $\\dbinom{12}{3}$ . Therefore, the probability of choosing three such factors is \\[\\frac{\\dbinom{21}{3} \\cdot \\dbinom{12}{3}}{190^3}.\\] Simplification gives $\\frac{77}{1805}$ , and therefore the answer is $\\boxed{077}$ .\n\n-molocyxu\n\nSolution 2:\nSame as before, say the factors have powers of $b$ and $c$ . $b_1, b_2, b_3$ can either be all distinct, all equal, or two of the three are equal. As well, we must have $b_1 \\leq b_2 \\leq b_3$ . If they are all distinct, the number of cases is simply ${19 \\choose 3}$ . If they are all equal, there are only $19$ cases for the general value. If we have a pair equal, then we have $2 \\cdot {19\\choose 2}$ . We need to multiply by $2$ because if we have two values $b_i < b_j$ , we can have either $(b_i, b_i, b_j)$ or $(b_i, b_j, b_j)$ .\n\n\\[{19 \\choose 3} + 2 \\cdot {19 \\choose 2} + 19 = 1330\\]\n\nLikewise for $c$ , we get\n\n\\[{10 \\choose 3} + 2 \\cdot {10 \\choose 2} + 10 = 220\\]\n\nThe final probability is simply $\\frac{1330 \\cdot 220}{190^3}$ . Simplification gives $\\frac{77}{1805}$ , and therefore the answer is $\\boxed{077}$ .\n\nSolution 3:\nSimilar to before, we calculate that there are $190^3$ ways to choose $3$ factors with replacement. Then, we figure out the number of triplets ${a,b,c}$ and ${d,f,g}$ , where $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ represent powers of $2$ and $d$ , $f$ , and $g$ represent powers of $5$ , such that the triplets are in non-descending order. The maximum power of $2$ is $18$ , and the maximum power of $5$ is $9$ . Using the Hockey Stick identity, we figure out that there are $\\dbinom{12}{3}$ ways to choose $d$ , $f$ and $g$ , and $\\dbinom{21}{3}$ ways to choose $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ . Therefore, the probability of choosing $3$ factors which satisfy the conditions is \\[\\frac{\\dbinom{21}{3} \\cdot \\dbinom{12}{3}}{190^3}.\\] This simplifies to $\\frac{77}{1805}$ , therefore $m =$ $\\boxed{077}$ .\n\nSolution 4 (Official MAA):\nNote that the prime factorization of $20^9$ is $2^{18}\\cdot5^{9}.$ The problem reduces to selecting independently the powers of $2$ and the powers of $5$ in the numbers $a_1$ , $a_2$ , and $a_3$ . This is equivalent to selecting $3$ exponents for the powers of $2$ and $3$ exponents for the powers of $5$ and determining in each case the probability that the 3 exponents are chosen in nondecreasing order.

Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$ , so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$ , and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$ . Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$ . Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$ . Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$ . ~awang11\n\nSolution 2:\nWe essentially have that $\\gcd(m,n) \\notin \\{1, m, n\\},$ or the set of factors of $210.$\n\nThis implies that one number must be odd and the other must be even so that they don’t add up to a multiple of $2.$ If $n$ is even and $m$ is odd it would be impossible for $m^m$ to be a multiple of $n^n,$ so $m$ must be even and $n$ must be odd.\n\nNow we need to choose the prime factor for $m$ and $n$ to share. It can't be $2,3,5,$ or $7$ so the next smallest option is $11.$\n\nSo far we have $m = 22$ and $n = 11.$ We need to add more factors so that $m$ is not a multiple of $n$ but $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n.$ Note that no matter how many additional factors we add to $m,$ it will always be a multiple of $11,$ so we have to add another factor to $n$ to make sure it doesn't divide $m.$ Again the smallest option is $11,$ so $n$ becomes $121 \\implies n^n = 11^{242},$ and $m^m = 2^{22} \\cdot 11^{22}.$ All we need to do now is significantly increase the value of $m$ so that the exponent on $11$ becomes larger than $242.$ If we added another factor of $11$ to $m$ then it would be a multiple of $n$ again, so the next smallest option is $13.$ Then $m = 22\\cdot 13 = 286.$ $m^m$ becomes $2^{286} \\cdot 11^{286} \\cdot 13^{286}$ which satisfies the problem's condition.\n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $m + n$ is $121 + 286 = \\boxed{407}.$\n\n~ grogg007\n\nSolution 3:\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that $n$ is a multiple of a single digit prime number, then $m$ must also be a multiple of that single digit prime number to accommodate for $n^n | m^m$ . However that means that $m+n$ is divisible by that single digit prime number, which violates $\\gcd(m+n,210) = 1$ , so contradiction.\n\n$n$ is also not 1 because then $m$ would be a multiple of it.\n\nThus, $n$ is a multiple of 11 and/or 13 and/or 17 and/or...\n\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that $n$ has at most 1 power of 11, at most 1 power of 13...and so on...\nThen, for $n^n | m^m$ to be satisfied, $m$ must contain at least the same prime factors that $n$ has. This tells us that for the primes where $n$ has one power of, $m$ also has at least one power, and since this holds true for all the primes of $n$ , $n|m$ . Contradiction.\n\nThus $n$ needs more than one power of some prime.\nThe obvious smallest possible value of $n$ now is $11^2 =121$ .\nSince $121^{121}=11^{242}$ , we need $m$ to be a multiple of 11 at least $242$ that is not divisible by $121$ and most importantly, $\\gcd(m+n,210) = 1$ . $242$ is divisible by $121$ , out. $253+121$ is divisible by 2, out. $264+121$ is divisible by 5, out. $275+121$ is divisible by 2, out. $286+121=37\\cdot 11$ and satisfies all the conditions in the given problem, and the next case $n=169$ will give us at least $169\\cdot 3$ , so we get $\\boxed{407}$ .\n\nSolution 4 (Official MAA):\nLet $m$ and $n$ be positive integers where $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$ and $m$ is not a multiple of $n$ . If a prime $p$ divides $n$ , then $p$ divides $n^n$ , so it also divides $m^m$ , and thus $p$ divides $m$ . Therefore any prime $p$ dividing $n$ also divides both $m$ and $k = m + n$ . Because $k$ is relatively prime to $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$ , the primes $2$ , $3$ , $5$ , and $7$ cannot divide $n$ . Furthermore, because $m$ is divisible by every prime factor of $n$ , but $m$ is not a multiple of $n$ , the integer $n$ must be divisible by the square of some prime, and that prime must be at least $11$ . Thus $n$ must be at least $11^2 = 121$ .\n\nIf $n=11^2$ , then $m$ must be a multiple of $11$ but not a multiple of $121$ , and $m^m$ must be divisible by $n^n = 121^{121} = 11^{242}$ . Therefore $m$ must be a multiple of $11$ that is greater than $242$ . Let $m = 11m_0$ , with $m_0 > 22$ . Then $k = m + n = 11(m_0 + 11)$ . The least $m_0 > 22$ for which $m_0 + 11$ is not divisible by any of the primes $2$ , $3$ , $5$ , or $7$ is $m_0 = 26$ , giving the prime $m_0 + 11 = 37$ . Hence the least possible $k$ when $n = 121$ is $k = 11 \\cdot 37 = 407$ .\n\nIt remains to consider other possible values for $n$ . If $n = 13^2 = 169$ , then $m$ must be divisible by $13$ but not $169$ , and $m^m$ must be a multiple of $n^n = 169^{169} = 13^{338}$ , so $m > 338$ . Then $k = m + n > 169 + 338 = 507$ . All other possible values for $n$ have $n \\ge 242$ , and in this case $m > n \\ge 242$ , so $k \\ge 2 \\cdot 242 = 484$ . Hence no greater values of $n$ can produce lesser values for $k$ , and the least possible $k$ is indeed $407$ ."}

If it is, note that by Vieta's formulas $a = -6$ . Then, $b$ can be anything. However, $c$ can also be anything, as we can set the root of $g$ (not equal to $f(2) = f(4)$ ) to any integer, producing a possible integer value of $d$ . Therefore there are $21^2 = 441$ in this case*. If it isn't, then $f(2),f(4)$ are the roots of $g$ . This means by Vieta's, that:\n\n\\[f(2)+f(4) = -c \\in [-10,10]\\] \\[20 + 6a + 2b \\in [-10,10]\\] \\[3a + b \\in [-15,-5].\\]\n\nSolving these inequalities while considering that $a \\neq -6$ to prevent $f(2) = f(4)$ , we obtain $69$ possible tuples and adding gives $441+69=\\boxed{510}$ .\n~awang11\n\nSolution 2 (Bash):\nDefine $h(x)=x^2+cx$ . Since $g(f(2))=g(f(4))=0$ , we know $h(f(2))=h(f(4))=-d$ . Plugging in $f(x)$ into $h(x)$ , we get $h(f(x))=x^4+2ax^3+(2b+a^2+c)x^2+(2ab+ac)x+(b^2+bc)$ . Setting $h(f(2))=h(f(4))$ , \\[16+16a+8b+4a^2+4ab+b^2+4c+2ac+bc=256+128a+32b+16a^2+8ab+b^2+16c+4ac+bc\\] . Simplifying and cancelling terms, \\[240+112a+24b+12a^2+4ab+12c+2ac=0\\] \\[120+56a+12b+6a^2+2ab+6c+ac=0\\] \\[6a^2+2ab+ac+56a+12b+6c+120=0\\] \\[6a^2+2ab+ac+20a+36a+12b+6c+120=0\\] \\[a(6a+2b+c+20)+6(6a+2b+c+20)=0\\] \\[(a+6)(6a+2b+c+20)=0\\]\n\nTherefore, either $a+6=0$ or $6a+2b+c=-20$ . The first case is easy: $a=-6$ and there are $441$ tuples in that case. In the second case, we simply perform casework on even values of $c$ , to get $77$ tuples, subtracting the $8$ tuples in both cases we get $441+77-8=\\boxed{510}$ .\n\n-EZmath2006\n\nSolution 3 (Official MAA):\nFor a given ordered triple $(a, b, c)$ , the value of $g(f(4)) - g(f(2))$ is uniquely determined, and a value of $d$ can be found to give $g(f(2))$ any prescribed integer value. Hence the required condition can be satisfied provided that $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are chosen so that \\begin{align*} 0 &= g(f(4)) - g(f(2)) = \\big(f(4)\\big)^{\\!2} - \\big(f(2)\\big)^{\\!2} + c\\big(f(4) - f(2)\\big)\\\\ &= \\big(f(4) - f(2)\\big)\\big(f(4) + f(2) + c\\big)\\\\ &= (12 + 2a)(20 + 6a + 2b + c). \\end{align*} First suppose that $12 + 2a = 0$ , so $a = -6$ . In this case there are $21$ choices for each of $b$ and $c$ with $-10 \\le b \\le 10$ and $-10 \\le c \\le 10$ , so this case accounts for $21^2 = 441$ ordered triples.\n\nNext suppose that $a \\ne -6$ and $20 + 6a + 2b + c = 0$ , so $c = -6a - 2b - 20$ . Because $-10 \\le c \\le 10$ , it follows that $-30 \\le 6a + 2b \\le -10$ , and because $-10\\le b \\le10$ , it follows that $-8 \\le a \\le 1$ . Then $-15 - 3a \\le b \\le -5 - 3a$ . The number of ordered triples for various values of $a$ are presented in the following table.\n\n\\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|r|} \\hline a  & b                  & c & triples \\\\ \\hline -8 & \\{9,10\\}           & -6a - 2b - 20    &             2              \\\\ -7 & \\{6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\} &   -6a - 2b - 20  &         5                  \\\\ -6 & \\{-10, \\ldots, 10\\} &  \\{-10, \\ldots, 10\\}   &                  441        \\\\ -5 & \\{0, \\ldots, 10\\}      &  -6a - 2b - 20   &    11                       \\\\ -4 & \\{-3, \\ldots, 7\\}        &  -6a - 2b - 20   &   11                       \\\\ -3 & \\{-6, \\ldots, 4\\}        &  -6a - 2b - 20   &   11                       \\\\ -2 & \\{-9, \\ldots, 1\\}         &  -6a - 2b - 20   &   11                        \\\\ -1 & \\{-10, \\ldots, -2\\}   &  -6a - 2b - 20   &           9                \\\\ 0  & \\{-10, \\ldots, -5\\}        &   -6a - 2b - 20  &      6                     \\\\ 1  & \\{-10, -9, -8\\}        &  -6a - 2b - 20   &      3                     \\\\ \\hline Total & & & 510\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\] The total number of ordered triples that satisfy the required condition is $\\boxed{510}$ ."}

Lifting the Exponent shows that \\[3=v_3(149^n-2^n) = v_3(n) + v_3(147) = v_3(n)+1\\] so thus, $3^2$ divides $n$ . It also shows that \\[7=v_7(149^n-2^n) = v_7(n) + v_7(147) = v_7(n)+2\\] so thus, $7^5$ divides $n$ .\n\nNow, setting $n = 4c$ (necessitated by $149^n \\equiv 2^n \\pmod 5$ in order to set up LTE), we see \\[v_5(149^{4c}-2^{4c}) = v_5(149^{4c}-16^{c})\\] and since $149^{4} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ and $16^1 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{25}$ then $v_5(149^{4c}-2^{4c})=v_5(149^4-16)+v_5(c)=1+v_5(c)$ meaning that we have that by LTE, $5^4 | c$ and $4 \\cdot 5^4$ divides $n$ .\n\nSince $3^2$ , $7^5$ and $4\\cdot 5^4$ all divide $n$ , the smallest value of $n$ working is their LCM, also $3^2 \\cdot 7^5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5^4 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^5$ . Thus the number of divisors is $(2+1)(2+1)(4+1)(5+1) = \\boxed{270}$ .\n\n~kevinmathz\n\nclarified by another user\n\nnotation note from another user\n\nSolution 1.2 (LTE + Binomial):\nFollow solution 1 to get that $3^2 \\cdot 7^5$ is a divisor of $n$ . We now take care of the $5^5$ part.\nRewrite $149^n-2^n$ as $(150-1)^n-2^n$ and assume $n$ is even. Since this expression is divisible by $5^5$ , we expand and get \\[\\binom n0(1^n)-\\binom n1(1^{n-1}150^1)+\\binom n2(1^{n-2}150^2)\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+\\binom nn(150^n)-2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod {5^5}.\\] Everything except the first three terms and the $2^n$ term is divisible by $5^5$ , so we can rewrite this as \\[1-150n+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}150^2-2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod {5^5},\\] And the following must be true: \\[1-150n+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}150^2-2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod {5^2}.\\] Since $150n+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}150^2$ divides $5^2$ , we can now see that \\[1-2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod {5^2}.\\] Solving for $n$ , $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod {2^2 \\cdot 5}$ .\nWe also know this is true: \\[1-150n+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}150^2-2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod {5^3}.\\] We know $n$ is divisible by $5$ , so $150n+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}150^2$ divides $5^3$ .\nAnd now, \\[1-2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod {5^3}\\] gives \\[n \\equiv 0 \\pmod {2^2 \\cdot 5^2}.\\] This process can be repeated until we obtain $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod {2^2 \\cdot 5^4}$ . The desired solution is then simply $\\text{lcm} (3^2 \\cdot 7^5, 2^2 \\cdot 5^4)$ which yields an answer of $(2+1)(5+1)(2+1)(4+1)=\\boxed{270}$ .\n\n~Marchk26\n\nSolution 2 (Simpler, just basic mods and Fermat's theorem):\nNote that for all $n$ , $149^n - 2^n$ is divisible by $149-2 = 147$ by difference of $n$ th powers. That is $3\\cdot7^2$ , so now we can clearly see that the smallest $n$ to make the expression divisible by $3^3$ is just $3^2$ . Similarly, we can reason that the smallest $n$ to make the expression divisible by $7^7$ is just $7^5$ .\n\nFinally, for $5^5$ , take $\\pmod {5}$ and $\\pmod {25}$ of each quantity (They happen to both be $-1$ and $2$ respectively, so you only need to compute once). One knows from Fermat's theorem that the maximum possible minimum $n$ for divisibility by $5$ is $4$ , and other values are factors of $4$ . Testing all of them(just $1$ , $2$ , $4$ using mods-not too bad), $4$ is indeed the smallest value to make the expression divisible by $5$ , and this clearly is NOT divisible by $25$ .\nTherefore, the smallest $n$ to make this expression divisible by $5^5$ is $2^2 \\cdot 5^4$ .\n\nCalculating the LCM of all these, one gets $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^5$ . Using the factor counting formula,\nthe answer is $3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot6$ = $\\boxed{270}$ .\n\n~Solution by thanosaops\n\n~formatted by MY-2 and pandyhu2001\n\nSolution 3 (Totient & Binomial Theorems):\nFor the $5^5$ case, we can see that the problem implies $149^n \\equiv 2^n \\pmod{5^5}.$\n\nThe modular inverse of $2 \\pmod{3125}$ is the least positive integer $x$ such that $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3125}.$ \\[x = \\frac{3125 + 1}{2} = 1563 \\implies (149\\cdot1563)^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5^5}.\\]\n\nNow we can use Euler's Totient Theorem, which states that if $\\gcd(a,b) = 1,$ then $a^{\\phi(b)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{b}.$ $\\phi(5^5) = 3125 \\cdot (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 2500,$ so $(149\\cdot1563)^{2500} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5^5}.$\n\nSo $n$ must be a multiple of $2500 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2.$\n\nNext, we consider modulo $27$ : \\[149^n - 2^n \\equiv 14^n - 2^n \\pmod{27} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{27}.\\] \\[14^n \\equiv 2^n \\pmod{27}\\] \\[7^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}\\] Apply Euler's Totient Theorem again to get $7^{18} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{27}.$\n\nSo $n$ needs to be a multiple of $9.$\n\nFor the $7^7$ case we can set up another congruence: \\[149^n - 2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7^7} \\implies (2 + 7 \\cdot 21)^n - 2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7^7}\\]\n\nTo continue evaluating we use the Binomial Theorem: \\[\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} 2^{n-k} (7 \\cdot 21)^k - 2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7^7}\\] \\[\\cancel{2^n} + \\binom{n}{1} 2^{n-1} (7 \\cdot 21) + \\binom{n}{2} 2^{n-2} (7 \\cdot 21)^2 + \\dots \\cancel{- 2^n} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7^7}\\] \\[\\binom{n}{1} \\cdot 2^{n-1} \\cdot 147 + \\binom{n}{2} 2^{n-2} \\cdot 147^2 + \\binom{n}{3} 2^{n-3} \\cdot 147^3 + \\binom{n}{4} 2^{n-4} \\cdot 147^4 \\dots \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7^7}.\\]\n\nSince $147 = 3 \\cdot 7^2,$ the first term is a multiple of $7^2,$ the second is a multiple of $7^4,$ and the third is a multiple of $7^6.$ Everything after is a multiple of $7^7.$\n\nSo $n$ must be a multiple of $7^5$ at the minimum for these three terms to also be multiples of $7^7.$\n\nPutting everything together we find the smallest value of $n$ to be $n = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^5,$ so the answer is $(2+1)(2+1)(4+1)(5+1) = \\boxed{270}.$\n\n~ grogg007\n\nSolution 4 (Elementary and Thorough):\nAs usual, denote $v_p(n)$ the highest power of prime $p$ that divides $n$ . For divisibility by $3^3$ , notice that $v_3(149^3 - 2^3) = 2$ as $149^3 - 2^3 =$ $(147)(149^2 + 2\\cdot149 + 2^2)$ , and upon checking mods, $149^2 + 2\\cdot149 + 2^2$ is divisible by $3$ but not $9$ . In addition, $149^9 - 2^9$ is divisible by $3^3$ because $149^9 - 2^9 = (149^3 - 2^3)(149^6 + 149^3\\cdot2^3 + 2^6)$ , and the rightmost factor equates to $1 + 1 + 1 \\pmod{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ . In fact, $n = 9 = 3^2$ is the least possible choice to ensure divisibility by $3^3$ because if $n = a \\cdot 3^b$ , with $3 \\nmid a$ and $b < 2$ , we write \\[149^{a \\cdot 3^b} - 2^{a \\cdot 3^b} =  (149^{3^b} - 2^{3^b})(149^{3^b(a - 1)} + 149^{3^b(a - 2)}\\cdot2^{3^b}+\\cdots2^{3^b(a - 1)}).\\] Then, the rightmost factor is equivalent to $\\pm a \\pmod{3} \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ , and $v_3(149^{3^b} - 2^{3^b}) = b + 1 < 3$ .\n\nFor divisibility by $7^7$ , we'll induct, claiming that $v_7(149^{7^k} - 2^{7^k}) = k + 2$ for whole numbers $k$ . The base case is clear. Then, \\[v_7(149^{7^{k+1}} - 2^{7^{k+1}}) = v_7(149^{7^k} - 2^{7^k}) + v_7(149^{6\\cdot7^k} + 2^{7^k}\\cdot149^{5\\cdot7^k} + \\cdots + 2^{5\\cdot7^k}\\cdot149^{7^k} + 2^{6\\cdot7^k}).\\] By the induction hypothesis, $v_7(149^{7^k} - 2^{7^k}) = k + 2$ . Then, notice that \\[S(k) = 149^{6\\cdot7^k} + 2^{7^k}\\cdot149^{5\\cdot7^k} + \\cdots + 2^{5\\cdot7^k}\\cdot149^{7^k} + 2^{6\\cdot7^k} \\equiv 7 \\cdot 2^{6\\cdot7^k}\\pmod{7} \\equiv 7 \\cdot 2^{6\\cdot7^k}\\pmod{49}.\\] This tells us that $S(k)$ is divisible by $7$ , but not $49$ so that $v_7\\left(S(k)\\right) = 1$ , completing our induction. We can verify that $7^5$ is the least choice of $n$ to ensure divisibility by $7^7$ by arguing similarly to the $3^3$ case.\n\nFinally, for $5^5$ , we take the powers of $149$ and $2$ in mod $5$ and mod $25$ . Writing out these mods, we have that $149^n \\equiv 2^n \\pmod{5}$ if and only if $4 | n$ , in which $149^n \\equiv 2^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ . So here we claim that $v_5(149^{4\\cdot5^k} - 2^{4\\cdot5^k}) = k + 1$ and perform yet another induction. The base case is true: $5 | 149^4 - 2^4$ , but $149^4 - 2^4 \\equiv 1 - 16 \\pmod{25}$ . Now then, assuming the induction statement to hold for some $k$ , \\[v_5(149^{4\\cdot5^{k+1}} - 2^{4\\cdot5^{k+1}}) = (k+1) + v_5(149^{4\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}+2^{4\\cdot5^k}\\cdot149^{3\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}+\\cdots+2^{3\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}\\cdot149^{4\\cdot5^k}+2^{4\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}).\\] Note that $S'(k) =  149^{4\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}+2^{4\\cdot5^k}\\cdot149^{3\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}+\\cdots+2^{3\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}\\cdot149^{4\\cdot5^k}+2^{4\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}$ equates to $S''(k) = 1 + 2^{4\\cdot5^k} + \\cdots + 2^{16\\cdot5^k}$ in both mod $5$ and mod $25$ . We notice that $S''(k) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ . Writing out the powers of $2$ mod $25$ , we have $S''(0) \\equiv 5 \\pmod{25}$ . Also $2^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ when $n$ is a multiple of $20$ . Hence for $k > 0$ , $S''(k) \\equiv 5 \\mod{25}$ . Thus, $v_5\\left(S'(k)\\right) = 1$ , completing our induction. Applying the same argument from the previous two cases, $4\\cdot5^4$ is the least choice to ensure divisibility by $5^5$ .\n\nOur answer is the number of divisors of $\\text{lcm}(3^2, 7^5, 2^2\\cdot5^4) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^5$ . It is $(2 + 1)(2 + 1)(4 + 1)(5 + 1) = \\boxed{270}$ .\n\n~hnkevin42\n\nSolution 5 (Official MAA):\nAnalyze each prime power separately.\nStart with the case of $3^3$ . By the Binomial Theorem, \\begin{align*} \t\t149^n - 2^n &= (147+2)^n - 2^n \\\\ \t\t&= \\binom n1 \\cdot 147 \\cdot 2^{n-1} \t\t+ \\binom n2 \\cdot 147^2 \\cdot 2^{n-2}\\\\ \t\t&\\qquad+ \\binom n3 \\cdot 147^3 \\cdot 2^{n-3} \t\t+ \\cdots. \t\\end{align*} Because $147$ is divisible by $3$ , all terms after the first two are divisible by $3^3$ , and the exponent of $3$ in the first term is less than that in the second term. Hence it is necessary and sufficient that $3^3 \\mid 147n$ , that is, $3^2 \\mid n$ .\nFor the $7^7$ case, consider the same expansion as in the previous case. Because $147$ is divisible by $49 = 7^2$ , all terms after the first three are divisible by $7^7$ , and the exponent of $7$ in the first term is less than that in the second and third term. Hence it is necessary and sufficient that $7^7 \\mid 147n$ , that is, $7^5 \\mid n$ .\nFor the $5^5$ case, working modulo $5$ gives $149^n - 2^n \\equiv 4^n - 2^n = 2^n(2^n-1) \\pmod 5$ , so it must be that $4 \\mid n$ . Let $n = 4m$ , and let $c = 149^4 - 2^4 = (149^2-2^2)(149^2+2^2) = 147 \\cdot 151 \\cdot 22205$ . Note that $\\frac c5$ is an integer not divisible by $5$ . Expand by the Binomial Theorem again to get \\begin{align*} \t\t(149^4)^m - (2^4)^m &= (c+16)^m - (16)^m \\\\ \t\t&= \\binom m1 \\cdot c \\cdot 16^{m-1} \t\t+ \\binom m2 \\cdot c^2 \\cdot 16^{m-2} \\\\ \t\t&\\qquad+ \\binom m3 \\cdot c^3 \\cdot 16^{m-3} \t\t+ \\binom m4 \\cdot c^4 \\cdot 16^{m-4} \t\t+ \\cdots. \t\\end{align*} All terms after the first four are divisible by $5^5$ , and the exponent of $5$ in the first term is less than that in the second, third, or fourth term. Hence it is necessary and sufficient that $5^5 \\mid cm$ . Thus $5^4 \\mid m$ , and it follows that $4 \\cdot 5^4 \\mid n$ .\nTherefore the least $n$ is $3^2 \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 5^4) \\cdot 7^5$ . The requested number of divisors is $(1+2)(1+2)(1+4)(1+5) = 270$ .\n\nThe results of the above cases can be generalized using the following lemma.\n\nLifting the Exponent Lemma: Let $p$ be an odd prime, and let $a$ and $b$ be integers relatively prime to $p$ such that $p \\mid (a-b)$ . Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then the number of factors of $p$ that divide $a^n - b^n$ is equal to the number of factors of $p$ that divide $a-b$ plus the number of factors of $p$ that divide $n$ ."}

Since $\\angle{AFE} = \\angle{AGD}$ , and $\\angle{AEF} = \\angle{AHD}$ , it is a breakthrough to get $\\triangle AFE \\sim \\triangle AGH$ . We'd like to compare altitudes to help us compare their areas. Now, note that $AD/2$ is the altitude of $\\triangle AFE$ , and Stewart's theorem implies that $AD/2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{18}}{2}$ . Similarly, the altitude of $\\triangle AGH$ is the altitude of $\\triangle ABC$ , or $\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2}$ . However, by the symmetry axis $BE$ on quadrilateral $ABHE$ , we have $BH = AB = 4$ , and similarly $CG = CA = 6$ , so $GB = HC = 1$ , and therefore $[AGH] = [ABC]$ . From here, we get that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{15\\sqrt{7}}{14} \\implies \\boxed{036}$ , by similarity. ~awang11 ~gougutheorem\n\nSolution 2:\nLet $M_A$ , $M_B$ , $M_C$ be the midpoints of arcs $BC$ , $CA$ , $AB$ . By Fact 5, we know that $M_AB = M_AC = M_AI$ , and so by Ptolmey's theorem, we deduce that \\[AB\\cdot M_AC + AC\\cdot M_AB = BC\\cdot M_AA \\implies M_AA = 2M_AI.\\] In particular, we have $AI = IM_A$ . [asy] defaultpen(fontsize(10pt)); size(200); pair A, B, C, D, E, F, I, P, MA, MB, MC; B = (0,0); C = (5,0); A = IP(Circle(B, 4), Circle(C, 6), 0); I = incenter(A, B, C); D = extension(A, I, B, C); P = midpoint(A--D); E = extension(P, rotate(90, P)*A, B, I); F = extension(P, rotate(90, P)*A, C, I); MA = IP(Line(A, I, 20), circumcircle(A, B, C), 1); MB = IP(Line(B, I, 20), circumcircle(A, B, C), 1); MC = IP(Line(C, I, 20), circumcircle(A, B, C), 1); draw(A--B--C--cycle, orange); draw(circumcircle(A, B, C), red); draw(A--E--F--cycle, lightblue); draw(E--D--F, lightblue); draw(A--MA^^B--MB^^C--MC, heavygreen); draw(MA--MB--MC--cycle, magenta); dot(\"$A$\", A, dir(120)); dot(\"$B$\", B, dir(220)); dot(\"$C$\", C, dir(320)); dot(\"$D$\", D, dir(230)); dot(\"$E$\", E, dir(330)); dot(\"$F$\", F, dir(250)); dot(\"$I$\", I, dir(80)); dot(\"$M_A$\", MA, dir(270)); dot(\"$M_B$\", MB, dir(60)); dot(\"$M_C$\", MC, dir(150)); [/asy] Now the key claim is that:\n\nClaim: $\\triangle DEF$ and $\\triangle M_AM_BM_C$ are homothetic at $I$ with ratio $2$ .\n\nProof. First, we show that $D$ is the midpoint of $M_AI$ . Indeed, we have \\[\\frac{ID}{DM_A} = \\frac{BI}{BM_A}\\cdot \\frac{\\sin\\angle IBC}{\\sin \\angle CBM_A} = \\frac{BI}{AI}\\cdot\\frac{\\sin \\angle B/2}{\\sin \\angle A/2} = 1\\] by Ratio lemma and Law of Sines.\n\nNow observe that:\n\n$\\overline{M_BM_C}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AI}$ , $\\overline{EF}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AD}$ , and $ID = AI/2$ .\n\nCombining these facts gives that $\\overline{EF}$ is a midline in $\\triangle IM_BM_C$ , which proves the claim. $\\blacksquare$\n\nTo finish, we compute $[M_AM_BM_C]$ , noting that $[AEF] = [DEF] = \\tfrac{1}{4}[M_AM_BM_C]$ .\n\nBy Heron's, we can calculate the circumradius $R = 8/\\sqrt{7}$ , and by Law of Cosines, we get \\begin{align*}\\cos A &= \\frac{9}{16}\\implies \\cos A/2 = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{32}} \\\\ \\cos B &= \\frac{1}{8} \\implies \\cos B/2 = \\frac{3}{4} \\\\ \\cos C &= \\frac{3}{4} \\implies \\cos C/2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{8}}.\\end{align*} Then using $[XYZ] = 2R^2\\sin X\\sin Y\\sin Z$ , we can compute \\[[M_AM_BM_C] = 2\\cdot \\frac{64}{7}\\cdot \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{32}}\\cdot \\frac{3}{4}\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{30\\sqrt{7}}{7}.\\] Thus $[AEF] = 15\\sqrt{7}/14$ , which gives a final answer of $\\boxed{036}$ .\n\n~pinetree1\n\nSolution 3(coord bash + basic geometry):\nLet $\\overline{BC}$ lie on the x-axis and $B$ be the origin. $C$ is $(5,0)$ . Use Heron's formula to compute the area of triangle $ABC$ . We have $s=\\frac{15}{2}$ . and $[ABC]=\\sqrt{\\frac{15 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3}{2^4}}=\\frac{15\\sqrt{7}}{4}$ . We now find the altitude, which is $\\frac{\\frac{15\\sqrt{7}}{2}}{5}=\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2}$ , which is the y-coordinate of $A$ . We now find the x-coordinate of $A$ , which satisfies $x^2 + (\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2})^{2}=16$ , which gives $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ since the triangle is acute. Now using the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have $\\frac{4}{6}=\\frac{BD}{CD}$ and $BD+CD=5$ to get $BD=2$ . The coordinates of D are $(2,0)$ .\nSince we want the area of triangle $AEF$ , we will find equations for perpendicular bisector of AD, and the other two angle bisectors. The perpendicular bisector is not too challenging: the midpoint of AD is $(\\frac{5}{4}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{4})$ and the slope of AD is $-\\sqrt{7}$ . The slope of the perpendicular bisector is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}$ . The equation is(in point slope form) $y-\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{4}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}(x-\\frac{5}{4})$ .\nThe slope of AB, or in trig words, the tangent of $\\angle ABC$ is $3\\sqrt{7}$ .\nFinding $\\sin{\\angle ABC}=\\frac{\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2}}{4}=\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{8}$ and $\\cos{\\angle ABC}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{4}=\\frac{1}{8}$ . Plugging this in to half angle tangent, it gives $\\frac{\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{8}}{1+\\frac{1}{8}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ as the slope of the angle bisector, since it passes through $B$ , the equation is $y=\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{3}x$ .\nSimilarly, the equation for the angle bisector of $C$ will be $y=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}(x-5)$ .\nFor $E$ use the B-angle bisector and the perpendicular bisector of AD equations to intersect at $(3,\\sqrt{7})$ .\nFor $F$ use the C-angle bisector and the perpendicular bisector of AD equations to intersect at $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{9}{2\\sqrt{7}})$ .\nThe area of AEF is equal to $\\frac{EF \\cdot \\frac{AD}{2}}{2}$ since AD is the altitude of that triangle with EF as the base, with $\\frac{AD}{2}$ being the height. $EF=\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{7}}$ and $AD=3\\sqrt{2}$ , so $[AEF]=\\frac{15}{2\\sqrt{7}}=\\frac{15\\sqrt{7}}{14}$ which gives $\\boxed{036}$ . NEVER overlook coordinate bash in combination with beginner synthetic techniques.~vvluo\n\nSolution 4 (Coordinate Bash + Trig):\n[asy]         size(8cm); defaultpen(fontsize(10pt));          pair A,B,C,I,D,M,T,Y,Z,EE,F;         A=(0,3sqrt(7));         B=(-1,0);         C=(9,0);         I=incenter(A,B,C);         D=extension(A,I,B,C);         M=(A+D)/2;          draw(B--EE,gray+dashed);         draw(C--F,gray+dashed);         draw(A--B--C--A);         draw(A--D);         draw(B--(5,sqrt(28)));         draw(M--(5,sqrt(28)));         draw(C--(0,9sqrt(7)/7));         draw(M--(0,9sqrt(7)/7));         dot(\"$A$\",A,NW);         dot(\"$B$\",B,SW);         dot(\"$C$\",C,SE);         dot(\"$D$\",D,S);         dot(\"$E$\",(5,sqrt(28)),N);          dot(\"$M$\",M,dir(70));         dot(\"$F$\",(0,9sqrt(7)/7),N);          label(\"$2$\",B--D,S);         label(\"$3$\",D--C,S);         label(\"$6$\",A--C,N);         label(\"$4$\",A--B,W);     [/asy]\n\nLet $B=(0,0)$ and $BC$ be the line $y=0$ .\nWe compute that $\\cos{\\angle{ABC}}=\\frac{1}{8}$ , so $\\tan{\\angle{ABC}}=3\\sqrt{7}$ .\nThus, $A$ lies on the line $y=3x\\sqrt{7}$ .

Since the line passes $(5,0)$ , we can set the equation to get the $CF:y=-\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{7}+\\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{7}$ , find the intersection of $CF,EF$ , $-\\frac{\\sqrt{7}x}{7}+\\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{7}=\\frac{\\sqrt{7}x}{7}+\\frac{4\\sqrt{7}}{7}$ , getting that $F:(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{14})$ and in the end we use shoelace theorem with coordinates of $A,F,E$ getting the area $\\frac{15\\sqrt{7}}{14}$ leads to the final answer $\\boxed{36}$\n\n~bluesoul\n\nSolution 12 (Simple geometry):\n2020 AIME I 13a.png\n\nUsing the Claim (below) we get $I$ is orthocenter of $\\triangle DEF,\\angle EDG = \\beta,$ $\\angle FDG = \\gamma.$ So area of $\\triangle DEF$ is \\[[\\triangle DEF] =\\frac {DG \\cdot FE}{2} = \\frac {AD^2}{8} (\\tan \\beta + \\tan \\gamma).\\]\n\nSemiperimeter of $\\triangle ABC \\hspace{10mm} s = \\frac{15}{2},$ so the bisector \\[AD= \\frac{2}{AB + AC}\\sqrt{s(s-BC) \\cdot AB\\cdot AC} = 3\\sqrt{2}.\\]\n\nWe get the inradius by applying Heron's formula \\[r = \\sqrt{\\frac {(s-AB)(s-BC)(s-AC)}{s}} = \\sqrt {\\frac {3\\cdot 5 \\cdot 7}{15 \\cdot 4}}=\\frac {\\sqrt {7}}{2}.\\]\n\nWe use formulas for inradius and get \\[\\tan \\beta = \\frac{r}{s – AC} = \\frac {\\sqrt {7}}{3} , \\hspace{10mm} \\tan \\gamma  = \\frac{r}{s – AB} = \\frac {\\sqrt {7}}{7}.\\] The area $\\hspace{30mm} [\\triangle DEF] = \\frac{15 \\sqrt 7}{14}.$\n\n2020 AIME I 13.png\n\nClaim\n\nLet $I$ be incenter of $\\triangle ABC.$ Then bisector $\\overline{BI},$ perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AD},$ and perpendicular dropped to bisector $\\overline{CI}$ from point $D$ are concurrent.\n\nProof\n\nDenote $\\angle BAC = 2 \\alpha,  \\angle ABC = 2\\beta,\\angle ACB = 2 \\gamma.$ Then $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 90^\\circ.$ Denote $P$ the intersection point of $BC$ and the tangent line to the circumcircle at point $A.$\n\nWLOC, $\\hspace{20mm}\\gamma > \\beta$ (case $\\gamma = \\beta$ is trivial).\n\n$\\angle PAC = \\angle ABC = 2 \\beta$ (this angles are measured by half the arc $\\overset{\\Large\\frown} {AC}$ of the circumcircle).\n\n\\[\\angle APC = \\angle ACD - \\angle PAC = 2(\\gamma - \\beta),\\] \\[\\angle ADP = 180^o – \\angle DAC - \\angle ACD = 180^o – \\alpha – 2 \\gamma = \\alpha + 2 \\beta = \\angle DAP \\implies AP = DP.\\] Therefore bisector of angle P coincite with the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AD}$ .\n\nBy applying the Law of Sines to $\\triangle ABP$ we get $\\hspace{20mm}\\frac {BP}{AP} =  \\frac {\\sin 2 \\gamma}{\\sin 2 \\beta.}$\n\nLet $E$ be crosspoint of $PG$ and bisector $BI.$ By applying the Law of Sines to $\\triangle BEP$ we get \\[\\frac {EP}{BP} = \\frac {\\sin \\beta}{\\sin(180^o – \\beta – (\\gamma – \\beta))}= \\frac {\\sin \\beta}{\\sin \\gamma}.\\]\n\nLet $E'$ be crosspoint of $PG$ and the perpendicular dropped to bisector $\\overline{CI}$ from point $D.$ \\[\\frac {E'P}{DP} = \\frac {\\sin (90^\\circ – \\gamma)}{\\sin(180^o - (90^o – \\gamma) – (\\gamma - \\beta))}= \\frac {\\cos\\gamma}{\\cos \\beta}.\\] $\\hspace{50mm}\\frac {E'P} {EP} = \\frac {E'P}{DP} \\cdot \\frac {AP}{BP} \\cdot \\frac {BP}{EP} = \\frac {\\cos\\gamma}{\\cos \\beta} \\cdot \\frac {\\sin 2\\beta}{\\sin 2\\gamma}\\cdot \\frac {\\sin\\gamma}{\\sin \\beta} = 1 \\implies  E$ coincide with $E'.$\n\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss\n\nSolution 13 (Trig):\nDenote $I$ as the incenter of $\\triangle ABC$ and $M$ as the intersecting point of $AD$ and $EF$ .\n\nWe solve this question based on this equation: $[\\triangle AEF]=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\times AM\\times (\\dfrac{IM}{\\tan{\\angle EFI}}+\\dfrac{IM}{\\tan{\\angle FEI}})$ .\n\nFirstly, let's compute the trig value of $\\angle EFI$ and $\\angle FEI$ . Using the Cosine Law and half-angle formula, we obtain: \\[\\cos{\\angle B}=\\dfrac{1}{8}, \\sin{\\dfrac{\\angle B}{2}}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{7}}{4}, \\cos{\\dfrac{\\angle B}{2}}=\\dfrac{3}{4}\\] \\[\\cos{\\angle C}=\\dfrac{3}{4}, \\sin{\\dfrac{\\angle C}{2}}=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}, \\cos{\\dfrac{\\angle C}{2}}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{8}}\\]\n\nNoticing that by angle chasing, $\\angle EFI= 90^{\\circ}-\\angle FIA=90^{\\circ}-\\angle CID=90^{\\circ}-(180^{\\circ}-\\dfrac{\\angle A}{2}-\\angle B-\\dfrac{\\angle C}{2})= \\dfrac{\\angle B}{2}$ .\nSimilarly, $\\angle FEI=\\dfrac{\\angle C}{2}$ .\nThus, $\\tan{\\angle EFI}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ and $\\tan{\\angle FEI}=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}$\n\nThen we find $AM$ : by Stewart's theorem, $AM=\\dfrac{AD}{2}=\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ .\n\nFor $MI$ , first noticing that $MI=MD-ID=\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}-ID$ .\nThen, by Angel Bisector's theorem, we have $BD=2, CD=3$ , and applying Sine Law: \\[\\dfrac{ID}{\\sin{\\dfrac{\\angle C}{2}}}=\\dfrac{CD}{\\sin{\\angle CID}}\\] \\[\\dfrac{ID}{\\sin{\\dfrac{\\angle C}{2}}}=\\dfrac{CD}{\\cos{\\dfrac{\\angle B}{2}}}\\] Substituting the known values, we get $ID=\\sqrt{2}$ . Thus, $MI=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n\nNow, we already find all the unknown values in the very beginning equation. Substituting all the values, we obtain $[\\triangle AEF]=\\dfrac{15\\sqrt{7}}{14}$ , which gives a final answer of $\\boxed{036}$ .\n\n~Ericcc\n\nSolution 14 (No Trig, No Coordinate Bashing, Simple Geometry):\n2020AIMEp13DIAGRAM14.jpeg\n\n[AUTHOR'S NOTE: Someone please help make a better diagram...]\n\nBy Angle Bisector Theorem, $BD=2,DC=3$ . By Stewart's, $AD=3\\sqrt2$ , so $AK=\\dfrac{3\\sqrt2}{2}$ . Thus, it suffices to find $FE$ .\n\nNotice that $\\triangle AIK \\cong \\triangle DIK$ , because $IK$ is the perpendicular bisector of $AD$ . Also notice that $\\triangle AIK \\cong \\triangle AJK$ by $SAS$ . Thus, $AJDI$ is a rhombus, and $AI \\parallel JD, AJ\\parallel ID$ .\n\nNow notice $\\triangle CJD \\sim \\triangle CAB$ by $AAA$ . Since $\\dfrac{CD}{CB}=\\dfrac{JD}{AB}=\\dfrac{3}{5}$ , we have that $JD=ID=IA=AJ=\\dfrac{12}{5}$ . Thus, by Pythagorean Theorem, $KJ=\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{14}}{10},IJ=\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{14}}{5}.$\n\nWe now do some length chasing. $BI=4-\\dfrac{12}{5}=\\dfrac{8}{5},CJ=6-\\dfrac{12}{5}=\\dfrac{18}{5}.$ By Angle Bisector Theorem on $\\triangle BID,$ we have $IL=\\dfrac{16}{15}$ . Similarly on $\\triangle CJD$ , $JM=\\dfrac{72}{55}.$ We also have $AG=\\dfrac{24}{11}$ and $AH=\\dfrac{8}{3}$ by Angle Bisector Theorem on $\\triangle ABC$ . Thus, $GI=AI-AG=\\dfrac{12}{5}-\\dfrac{24}{11}=\\dfrac{12}{55}$ , and $JH=AH-AJ=\\dfrac{8}{3}-\\dfrac{12}{5}=\\dfrac{4}{15}.$\n\nIt is easily shown that $\\triangle GIF \\sim \\triangle JMF$ , so by the side length ratios, we have \\[\\dfrac{JM}{GI}=\\dfrac{JF}{IF}=\\dfrac{\\frac{72}{55}}{\\frac{12}{55}}=6.\\] Similarly, we can see that $\\triangle EJH \\sim \\triangle EIL$ , so by the side length ratios, we have \\[\\dfrac{IL}{JK}=\\dfrac{EI}{JE}=\\dfrac{\\frac{16}{15}}{\\frac{4}{15}}=4.\\] So, we can see that the length of $FE$ is $\\dfrac{6}{7}+\\dfrac{1}{3}=\\dfrac{25}{21}$ times the length of $IJ$ . However, the length of $IJ$ is $\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{14}}{5}$ , so $FE=\\dfrac{5\\sqrt{14}}{7}$ , and the area of $\\triangle AFE$ is $\\dfrac{1}{2}\\times \\dfrac{5\\sqrt{14}}{7}\\times \\dfrac{3\\sqrt2}{2}=\\dfrac{15\\sqrt7}{14}.$ Thus, the desired answer is $15+7+14=\\boxed{036}.$\n\n~easond\n\nSolution 15(Similar to Solutions with analytic geometry but this is pure coordinate bash):\nSet $B$ to be at $(0, 0)$ . Then $C$ will be at $(5, 0)$ . Let $A$ be at $(x, y)$ . Hence,\n\n$x^{2} + y^{2} = 16$\n\n$(x - 5)^{2} + y^{2} = 36$\n\nSubtracting yields\n\n$x^{2} - 10x + 25 - x^{2} = 20 \\implies 10x = 5 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nThen $y = 16 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{63}{4} \\implies y = \\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2}$\n\nNow by the Angle Bisector Theorem, $\\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{BD}{DC} \\implies \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{x}{5 - x}$ since $BD + DC = 5$ . Now $10 - 2x = 3x \\implies x = 2$ . Hence $D$ is at $(2, 0)$ . Let the point where $BE$ intersects $AC$ be $G$ and likewise $H$ for the point where $CF$ intersects $AB$ . By the Angle Bisector Theorem,\n\n$\\frac{AB}{BC} = \\frac{AG}{GB} \\implies \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{x}{6 - x}$ . Solving yields $x = \\frac{8}{3}$ and so $AG = \\frac{8}{3}$ and $GC = \\frac{10}{3}$ . Doing similar things to finding the length of $AH$ , we get $AH = \\frac{24}{11}$ and $HB = \\frac{20}{11}$ .\n\nNow we find the equation of line $AC$ . The slope is just $\\frac{\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2} - 5} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ . Hence the equation of $AC$ is $y = -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3} + b$ and we can plug in point $(5, 0)$ because it lies on line $AC$ to get $0 = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{3} + b$ and solve to get the equation of line $AC$ is just $y = -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ .\n\nTherefore, any point on line $AC$ must have the form $(x, -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{3})$ . Let $G$ be at point $(x, -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{3})$ . We know $GC$ is just $\\frac{10}{3}$ so the distance between points $(x, -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{3})$ and $(5, 0)$ is just $\\frac{10}{3}$ . Solving, we get $x = \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{15}{2}$ but we know $x$ can at most be $5$ hence only $x = \\frac{5}{2}$ works. Thus, $G$ will be at point $(\\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{6})$ .\n\nThe same process applies for finding the coordinates of point $H$ . We end up with $H$ being at point $(\\frac{5}{22}, \\frac{15\\sqrt{7}}{22})$ .\n\nWe now find the equation of $BE$ . Note that the slope is just $\\frac{\\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{6}}{\\frac{5}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ . We know that $B$ is at the origin and so the equation of line $BE$ is just $y = \\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ .\n\nThen find the equation of $CF$ in a similar way. We get $y = -\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{7} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{7}$ .\n\nFinally, the last step is finding the equation of the perpendicular bisector of $AD$ . Note that the slope of $AD$ is just $\\frac{\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2} - 2} = -\\sqrt{7}$ . Hence the slope of the perpendicular bisector is just $\\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{7}$ because that is the negative reciprocal of $-\\sqrt{7}$ . We also know that because this is the bisector, it passes through the midpoint of $AD$ which is just $(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + 2}{2}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{4}) = (\\frac{5}{4}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{4})$ . Therefore $y = -x\\sqrt{7} + b$ and we know $(\\frac{5}{4}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{4})$ is on it and plugging this in and solving and simplifying, we end up with the equation of the perpendicular bisector of $AD$ :\n\n$y = \\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{7} + \\frac{4\\sqrt{7}}{7}$ .\n\nTo find the coordinates of $E$ , note that $BE$ intersects the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ at $E$ so we just need to solve $\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{3} = \\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{7} + \\frac{4\\sqrt{7}}{7}$ and we get $x = 3$ and so point $E$ is on $(3, \\sqrt{7})$ .\n\nSimilarly, to find the coordinates of $F$ , note that $CF$ intersects the perpendicular bisector of $AD$ at point $F$ so we just need to solve $-\\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{7} + \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{7} = \\frac{x\\sqrt{7}}{7} + \\frac{4\\sqrt{7}}{7}$ and we get $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ . Thus point $F$ is on $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{14})$ .\n\nNow we have everything we need. We know $A$ is on $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2})$ , $E$ is on $(3, \\sqrt{7})$ , and $F$ is on $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{14})$ .\n\nWe apply Shoelace Theorem to finish the problem off:\n\n$[AEF] = \\frac{1}{2} \\mid (\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{14} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{7} + 3 \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2}) - (\\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{14} \\cdot 3 + \\sqrt{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}) \\mid = \\frac{1}{2} \\mid \\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{28} + \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} + \\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{2} - \\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{4} - \\frac{27\\sqrt{7}}{14} - \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\mid = \\frac{1}{2} \\mid \\frac{60\\sqrt{7}}{28} \\mid = \\frac{15\\sqrt{7}}{14}$ .\n\nHence, $[AEF] = \\frac{15\\sqrt{7}}{14}$ . Then the answer is just $15 + 7 + 14 = \\boxed{036}$ .\n\n~ilikemath247365"}

We first see that if $P(3) = P(4)$ it's easy to obtain by Vieta's that $(a+b)^2 = 49$ . Now, take $P(3) \\neq P(4)$ and WLOG $P(3) = P(a), P(4) = P(b)$ . Now, consider the parabola formed by the graph of $P$ . It has vertex $\\frac{3+a}{2}$ . Now, say that $P(x) = x^2 - (3+a)x + c$ . We note $P(3)P(4) = c = P(3)\\left(4 - 4a + \\frac{8a - 1}{2}\\right) \\implies a = \\frac{7P(3) + 1}{8}$ . Now, we note $P(4) = \\frac{7}{2}$ by plugging in again. Now, it's easy to find that $a = -2.5, b = -3.5$ , yielding a value of $36$ . Finally, we add $49 + 36 = \\boxed{085}$ . ~awang11, charmander3333\n\nRemark : We know that $c=\\frac{8a-1}{2}$ from $P(3)+P(4)=3+a$ .\n\nSolution 2:\nLet the roots of $P(x)$ be $m$ and $n$ , then we can write \\[P(x)=x^2-(m+n)x+mn\\] The fact that $P(P(x))=0$ has solutions $x=3,4,a,b$ implies that some combination of $2$ of these are the solution to $P(x)=m$ , and the other $2$ are the solution to $P(x)=n$ . It's fairly easy to see there are only $2$ possible such groupings: $P(3)=P(4)=m$ and $P(a)=P(b)=n$ , or $P(3)=P(a)=m$ and $P(4)=P(b)=n$ (Note that $a,b$ are interchangeable, and so are $m$ and $n$ ). We now casework:\nIf $P(3)=P(4)=m$ , then \\[9-3(m+n)+mn=16-4(m+n)+mn=m \\implies m+n=7\\] \\[a^2-a(m+n)+mn=b^2-b(m+n)+mn=n \\implies a+b=m+n=7\\] so this gives $(a+b)^2=7^2=49$ .\nNext, if $P(3)=P(a)=m$ , then \\[9-3(m+n)+mn=a^2-a(m+n)+mn=m \\implies a+3=m+n\\] \\[16-4(m+n)+mn=b^2-b(m+n)+mn=n \\implies b+4=m+n\\] Subtracting the first part of the first equation from the first part of the second equation gives \\[7-(m+n)=n-m \\implies 2n=7 \\implies n=\\frac{7}{2} \\implies m=-3\\] Hence, $a+b=2(m+n)-7=2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}-7=-6$ , and so $(a+b)^2=(-6)^2=36$ .\nTherefore, the solution is $49+36=\\boxed{085}$ ~ktong\n\nSolution 3:\nWrite $P(x) = x^2+wx+z$ . Split the problem into two cases: $P(3)\\ne P(4)$ and $P(3) = P(4)$ .\n\nCase 1: We have $P(3) \\ne P(4)$ . We must have \\[w=-P(3)-P(4) = -(9+3w+z)-(16+4w+z) = -25-7w-2z.\\] Rearrange and divide through by $8$ to obtain \\[w = \\frac{-25-2z}{8}.\\] Now, note that \\[z = P(3)P(4) = (9+3w+z)(16+4w+z) = \\left(9 + 3\\cdot \\frac{-25-2z}{8} + z\\right)\\left(16 + 4 \\cdot \\frac{-25-2z}{8} + z\\right) =\\] \\[\\left(-\\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{z}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{21}{16} + \\frac{7z}{8}.\\] Now, rearrange to get \\[\\frac{z}{8} = -\\frac{21}{16}\\] and thus \\[z = -\\frac{21}{2}.\\] Substituting this into our equation for $w$ yields $w = -\\frac{1}{2}$ . Then, it is clear that $P$ does not have a double root at $P(3)$ , so we must have $P(a) = P(3)$ and $P(b) = P(4)$ or vice versa. This gives $3+a = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $4+b = \\frac{1}{2}$ or vice versa, implying that $a+b = 1-3-4 = -6$ and $(a+b)^2 = 36$ .\n\nCase 2: We have $P(3) = P(4)$ . Then, we must have $w = -7$ . It is clear that $P(a) = P(b)$ (we would otherwise get $P(a)=P(3)=P(4)$ implying $a \\in \\{3,4\\}$ or vice versa), so $a+b=-w=7$ and $(a+b)^2 = 49$ .\n\nThus, our final answer is $49+36=\\boxed{085}$ . ~GeronimoStilton\n\nSolution 4:\nLet $P(x) = (x - r)(x - s)$ where $r$ and $s$ are its roots.\n\nNote that \\[P(r) = P(s) = P(P(3)) = P(P(4)) = P(P(a)) = P(P(b)) = 0.\\] Since $P(x)$ is a quadratic, it can have at most two distinct roots, so there must be two pairs of $P(n)$ out of the four $P(3), P(4), P(a),$ and $P(b)$ which are equal to each other. (They have to be pairs because $P(x)$ can only have 2 roots, if we had something like $P(a) = P(3) = P(4) = r$ and $P(b) = s$ then $P(x)$ would have $3$ roots when counting multiplicity which is not possible.)\n\nCase 1: $P(3) = P(4).$\n\nThen $P(a) = P(b).$ WLOG, let $(3 - r)(3 - s)=(4 - r)(4 - s) = r$ and $(a - r)(a - s)=(b - r)(b - s)=s.$ Solving for $a + b$ gives us $a + b = r + s = 3 + 4 = 7 \\implies (a + b)^2 = 49.$\n\nCase 2: $P(3) \\neq P(4).$\n\nWLOG, let $P(3) = P(a) = r$ and $P(4) = P(b) = s.$ So $(3 - r)(3 - s) = r = (a - r)(a - s)$ and $(4 - r)(4 - s) = s = (b - r)(b - s).$ Subtracting $(4 - r)(4 - s) = s$ from $(3 - r)(3 - s) = r$ gives $-7 + r + s = r -s$ , so $s = \\frac{7}{2}.$ Plugging this back into $(4-r)(4-s) = s$ gives $r = -3.$ The coefficient of the $x^3$ term in $P(P(x))$ is $-2(r+s)$ , so by Vieta's Formulas the sum of the roots of $P(P(x))$ is $2$ times that of $P(x).$ We know $r + s = \\frac{1}{2}$ , so $3 + 4 + a + b = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 = 1.$ Then $a + b = -6 \\implies (a + b)^2 = 36.$\n\nThe requested sum is $36 + 49 =\\boxed{85}.$\n\n~ grogg007 , TheUltimate123\n\nSolution 5 (Official MAA):\nNote that because $P\\big(P(3)\\big)=P\\big(P(4)\\big)= 0$ , $P(3)$ and $P(4)$ are roots of $P(x)$ . There are two cases.\nCASE 1: $P(3) = P(4)$ . Then $P(x)$ is symmetric about $x=\\tfrac72$ ; that is to say, $P(r) = P(7-r)$ for all $r$ . Thus the remaining two roots must sum to $7$ . Indeed, the polynomials $P(x) = \\left(x-\\frac72\\right)^2 + \\frac{11}4 \\pm i\\sqrt3$ satisfy the conditions.\nCASE 2: $P(3)\\neq P(4)$ . Then $P(3)$ and $P(4)$ are the two distinct roots of $P(x)$ , so \\[P(x) = \\big(x-P(3)\\big)\\big(x-P(4)\\big)\\] for all $x$ . Note that any solution to $P\\big(P(x)\\big) = 0$ must satisfy either $P(x) = P(3)$ or $P(x) = P(4)$ . Because $P(x)$ is quadratic, the polynomials $P(x) - P(3)$ and $P(x) - P(4)$ each have the same sum of roots as the polynomial $P(x)$ , which is $P(3) + P(4)$ . Thus the answer in this case is $2\\big(P(3) + P(4)\\big)-7$ , and so it suffices to compute the value of $P(3)+P(4)$ .\n\nLet $P(3)=u$ and $P(4) = v$ . Substituting $x=3$ and $x=4$ into the above quadratic polynomial yields the system of equations \\begin{align*} u &= (3-u)(3-v) = 9 - 3u - 3v + uv\\\\ v &= (4-u)(4-v) = 16 - 4u - 4v + uv. \\end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $v - u = 7 - u - v$ , yielding $v = \\frac72.$ Substituting this value into the second equation gives \\[\\dfrac72 = \\left(4 - u\\right)\\left(4 - \\dfrac72\\right),\\] yielding $u = -3.$ The sum of the two solutions is $2\\left(\\tfrac72-3\\right)-7 = -6$ . In this case, $P(x)= (x+3)\\left(x-\\frac72\\right)$ .\n\nThe requested sum of squares is $7^2+(-6)^2 = \\boxed{085}$ .\n\nSolution 6:\nLet $P(x) = (x-c)^2 - d$ for some $c$ , $d$ .\n\nThen, we can write $P(P(x)) = ((x-c)^2 - d - c)^2 - d$ . Setting the expression equal to $0$ and solving for $x$ gives:\n\n$x = \\pm \\sqrt{ \\pm \\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$\n\nTherefore, we have that $x$ takes on the four values $\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$ , $-\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$ , $\\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$ , and $-\\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$ . Two of these values are $3$ and $4$ , and the other two are $a$ and $b$ .\n\nWe can split these four values into two \"groups\" based on the radicand in the expression - for example, the first group consists of the first two values listed above, and the second group consists of the other two values.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1}$ : Both the 3 and 4 values are from the same group.\n\nIn this case, the $a$ and $b$ values are both from the other group. The sum of this is just $2c$ because the radical cancels out. Because of this, we can see that $c$ is just the average of $3$ and $4$ , so we have $2c = 3 + 4 = 7$ , so $(a+b)^2 = 7^2 = 49$ .\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2}$ : The 3 and 4 values come from different groups.\n\nIt is easy to see that all possibilities in this case are basically symmetric and yield the same value for $(a+b)^2$ . Without loss of generality, assume that $\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c = 4$ and $\\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c = 3$ . Note that we can't switch the values of these two expressions since the first one is guaranteed to be larger.\n\nWe can write $\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c = 1 + \\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$ .\n\nMoving most terms to the left side and simplifying gives $\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} - \\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} = 1$ .\n\nWe can square both sides and simplify:\n\n$\\sqrt{d} + d + c - \\sqrt{d} + d + c - 2\\sqrt{(d + c + \\sqrt{d})(d + c - \\sqrt{d})} = 1$\n\n$2d + 2c - 2\\sqrt{(d + c + \\sqrt{d})(d + c - \\sqrt{d})} = 1$\n\n$\\sqrt{(d + c + \\sqrt{d})(d + c - \\sqrt{d})} = (d+c) - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$\\sqrt{(d+c)^2 - (\\sqrt{d})^2} = (d+c) - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$\\sqrt{d^2 + 2dc + c^2 - d} = (d+c) - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSquaring both sides again gives the following:\n\n$d^2 + 2dc + c^2 - d = d^2 + 2dc + c^2 - d - c + \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nNearly all terms cancel out, yielding $c = \\frac{1}{4}$ .\n\nBy substituting this back in, we obtain $\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} = \\frac{15}{4}$ and $\\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} = \\frac{11}{4}$ .\n\nThe sum of $a$ and $b$ is equal to $-\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} - \\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + 2c = -\\frac{15}{4} - \\frac{11}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = -6$ , so $(a+b)^2 = 36$ .\n\nAdding up both values gives $49 + 36 = \\boxed{085}$ as our final answer."}

Note that $3HX = HY$ is not insignificant; from here, we set $XH = HE = \\frac{1}{2} EY = HL = 2$ by PoP and trivial construction. Now, $D$ is the reflection of $A$ over $H$ . Note $AO \\perp XY$ , and therefore by Pythagorean theorem we have $AE = XD = \\sqrt{5}$ . Consider $HD = 3$ . We have that $\\triangle HXD \\cong HLK$ , and therefore we are ready to PoP with respect to $(BHC)$ . Setting $BL = x, LC = y$ , we obtain $xy = 10$ by PoP on $(ABC)$ , and furthermore, we have $KH^2 = 9 = (KL - x)(KL + y) = (\\sqrt{5} - x)(\\sqrt{5} + y)$ . Now, we get $4 = \\sqrt{5}(y - x) - xy$ , and from $xy = 10$ we take \\[\\frac{14}{\\sqrt{5}} = y - x.\\] However, squaring and manipulating with $xy = 10$ yields that $(x + y)^2 = \\frac{396}{5}$ and from here, since $AL = 5$ we get the area to be $3\\sqrt{55} \\implies \\boxed{058}$ . ~awang11's sol\n\nSolution 1a:\nAs in the diagram, let ray $AH$ extended hits BC at L and the circumcircle at say $P$ . By power of the point at H, we have $HX \\cdot HY = AH \\cdot HP$ . The three values we are given tells us that $HP=\\frac{2\\cdot 6}{3}=4$ . L is the midpoint of $HP$ (see here: https://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Geometry/AltitudeAndCircumcircle.shtml ), so $HL=LP=2$ .\n\nAs in the diagram provided, let K be the intersection of $BC$ and $XY$ . By power of a point on the circumcircle of triangle $HBC$ , $KH^{2}=KB \\cdot KC$ . By power of a point on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ , $KB \\cdot KC=KX \\cdot KY$ , thus $KH^{2}=(KH-2)(KH+6)$ . Solving gives $4KH=12$ or $KH=3$ .\n\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $HKL$ , $KL=\\sqrt{5}$ . Now continue with solution 1.\n\nSolution 2:\n[asy] size(10cm); pair A, B, C, D, H, K, O, P, L, M, X, Y; A = (-15, 27); B = (-24, 0); C = (24, 0); D = (-8.28, 18.04); O = (0, 7); P = (0, -7); H = (-15, 13); K = (-15, -13); M = (0, 0); L = (-15, 0); X = (-24.9569, 5.53234); Y = (8.39688, 30.5477); draw(circle(O, 25)); draw(circle(P, 25)); draw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(H -- K); draw(A -- O -- P -- H -- cycle); draw(X -- Y); draw(O -- X, dashed); draw(O -- Y, dashed); draw(O -- B, dashed); draw(O -- C, dashed);  label(\"$O$\", O, ENE); label(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, W); label(\"$C$\", C, E); label(\"$H$\", H, E); label(\"$H'$\", K, NE); label(\"$X$\", X, W); label(\"$Y$\", Y, NE); label(\"$O'$\", P, E); label(\"$M$\", M, NE); label(\"$L$\", L, NE); label(\"$D$\", D, NNE);  label(\"$2$\", X -- H, NW); label(\"$3$\", H -- A, SW); label(\"$6$\", H -- Y, NW); label(\"$R$\", O -- Y, E);  dot(O); dot(P); dot(D); dot(H);  [/asy] Diagram not to scale.\n\nWe first observe that $H'$ , the image of the reflection of $H$ over line $BC$ , lies on circle $O$ .  This is because $\\angle HBC = 90 - \\angle C = \\angle H'AC = \\angle H'BC$ .  This is a well known lemma.  The result of this observation is that circle $O'$ , the circumcircle of $\\triangle BHC$ is the image of circle $O$ over line $BC$ , which in turn implies that $\\overline{AH} = \\overline{OO'}$ and thus $AHO'O$ is a parallelogram.  That $AHO'O$ is a parallelogram implies that $AO$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{XY}$ , and thus divides segment $\\overline{XY}$ in two equal pieces, $\\overline{XD}$ and $\\overline{DY}$ , of length $4$ .\n\nUsing Power of a Point, \\[\\overline{AH} \\cdot \\overline{HH'} = \\overline{XH} \\cdot \\overline{HY} \\Longrightarrow 3 \\cdot \\overline{HH'} = 2 \\cdot 6 \\Longrightarrow \\overline{HH'} = 4\\] This means that $\\overline{HL} = \\frac12 \\cdot 4 = 2$ and $\\overline{AL} = 2 + 3 = 5$ , where $L$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ onto $BC$ .  All that remains to be found is the length of segment $\\overline{BC}$ .\n\nLooking at right triangle $\\triangle AHD$ , we find that \\[\\overline{AD} = \\sqrt{\\overline{AH}^2 - \\overline{HD}^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{5}\\] Looking at right triangle $\\triangle ODY$ , we get the equation \\[\\overline{OY}^2 - \\overline{DY}^2 = \\overline{OD}^2 = \\left(\\overline{AO} - \\overline{AD}\\right)^2\\] Plugging in known values, and letting $R$ be the radius of the circle, we find that \\[R^2 - 16 = (R - \\sqrt{5})^2 = R^2 - 2\\sqrt5 R + 5 \\Longrightarrow R = \\frac{21\\sqrt5}{10}\\]\n\nRecall that $AHO'O$ is a parallelogram, so $\\overline{AH} = \\overline{OO'} = 3$ .  So, $\\overline{OM} = \\frac32$ , where $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ .  This means that \\[\\overline{BC} = 2\\overline{BM} = 2\\sqrt{R^2 - \\left(\\frac32\\right)^2} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{441}{20} - \\frac{9}{4}} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{55}}{5}\\]\n\nThus, the area of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is \\[\\frac{\\overline{AL} \\cdot \\overline{BC}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot \\frac{6\\sqrt{55}}{5}}{2} = {3\\sqrt{55}}\\] The answer is $3 + 55 = \\boxed{058}$ .\n\nSolution 3 (Official MAA 1):\nExtend $\\overline{AH}$ to intersect $\\omega$ again at $P$ . The Power of a Point Theorem yields $HP = \\tfrac{HX \\cdot HY}{HA} = 4$ . Because $\\angle CAP=\\angle CBP$ , and $\\angle CAP$ and $\\angle CBH$ are both complements to $\\angle C$ , it follows that $\\angle CBP = \\angle CBH$ , implying that $\\overline{BC}$ bisects $\\overline{HP}$ , so the length of the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{BC}$ is $h_a = AH + \\tfrac12 HP = 5$ .\n\nLet the circumcircle of $\\triangle BCH$ be $\\omega'$ . Because $\\triangle BCH \\cong \\triangle BCP$ , the two triangles must have the same circumradius. Because the circumcircle of $\\triangle BCP$ is $\\omega$ , the circles $\\omega$ and $\\omega'$ have the same radius $R$ . Denote the centers of $\\omega$ and $\\omega'$ by $O$ and $O'$ , respectively, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{XY}$ . Note that trapezoid $HMOO'$ has $\\angle H = \\angle M = 90^\\circ$ . Also $HM = XM - XH = \\frac12\\cdot XY - HX = 2$ and $HO' = R$ . Because $\\omega$ is a translation of $\\omega'$ in the direction of $\\overline{AH}$ , it follows that $OO' = AH = 3$ . Finally, the Pythagorean Theorem applied to $\\triangle XMO$ yields $MO = \\sqrt{R^2-16}$ . Let $T$ be the projection of $O$ onto $\\overline{HO'}$ . Then $TO' = R-MO$ , so the Pythagorean Theorem applied to $\\triangle TOO'$ yields \\[R - \\sqrt{R^2-16} = \\sqrt{3^2 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{5}.\\] Solving for $R$ gives $R = \\tfrac{21}{2\\sqrt5}$ . It follows from properties of the orthocenter $H$ that \\[\\cos\\angle A = \\dfrac{AH}{2R} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt5}{7},\\] so \\[\\sin\\angle A = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2\\angle A} = \\dfrac{2\\sqrt{11}}{7}.\\] Therefore by the Extended Law of Sines \\[a = BC = 2R \\sin\\angle A = \\dfrac{6\\sqrt{11}}{\\sqrt5},\\] so \\[[\\triangle ABC] = \\frac12 a h_a = \\frac12 \\cdot \\frac{6\\sqrt{11}}{\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot 5 = 3\\sqrt{55}.\\] The requested sum is $3+55 = 58$ .\n\n[asy] unitsize(0.6 cm);  pair A, B, C, D, H, M, O, Op, P, T, X, Y, Z; real R = 21/(2*sqrt(5));  A = (7/sqrt(5),7/2); O = (0,0); B = intersectionpoint((0,-3/2)--(R,-3/2),Circle(O,R)); C = intersectionpoint((0,-3/2)--(-R,-3/2),Circle(O,R)); H = A + B + C; P = reflect(B,C)*(H); D = (H + P)/2; Op = reflect(B,C)*(O); X = intersectionpoint(H--(H + scale(2)*rotate(90)*(Op - H)), Circle(O,R)); Y = intersectionpoint(H--(H + scale(2)*rotate(90)*(H - Op)), Circle(O,R)); Z = extension(X, Y, B, C); M = (X + Y)/2; T = H + O - M;  draw(Circle(O,R)); draw(Circle(Op,R)); draw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(A--P); draw(B--Z--Y); draw(H--Op--O--M); draw(O--T); draw(O--X);  dot(\"$A$\", A, NE); dot(\"$B$\", B, SW); dot(\"$C$\", C, W); dot(\"$D$\", D, SW); dot(\"$H$\", H, NE); dot(\"$M$\", M, NE); dot(\"$O$\", O, W); dot(\"$O'$\", Op, W); dot(\"$P$\", P, SE); dot(\"$T$\", T, N); dot(\"$X$\", X, E); dot(\"$Y$\", Y, NW); dot(\"$Z$\", Z, E);  label(\"$\\omega$\", R*dir(140), dir(140)); label(\"$\\omega'$\", Op + R*dir(220), dir(220)); [/asy]\n\nSolution 3a (slightly modified Solution 3):\nNote that $\\overline{BC}$ bisects $\\overline{OO'}$ . Using the same method from Solution 3 we find $R = \\frac{21}{2\\sqrt{5}}$ . Let the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ be $N$ , then by the Pythagorean Theorem we have $BN^2 = OB^2 - ON^2 = R^2 - \\frac{3}{2}^2$ , so $BN = \\frac{3\\sqrt{11}}{\\sqrt{5}}$ . Since $h_a = 5$ we have that the area of ABC is $3\\sqrt{55}$ so the answer is $3 + 55 = \\boxed{58}$\n\n~bobjoebilly\n\nSolution 4 (Official MAA 2):\nLet $D$ be the intersection point of line $AH$ and $\\overline{BC}$ , noting that $\\overline{AD}\\perp\\overline{BC}$ . Because the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\tfrac12\\cdot AD\\cdot BC$ , it suffices to compute $AD$ and $BC$ separately. As in the previous solution, $AD = 5$ . The value of $BC$ can be found using the following lemma.\n\nLemma: Triangle $AXY$ is isosceles with base $\\overline{XY}$ .\n\nProof: Because the circumcircle of $\\triangle BCH$ , $\\omega'$ , and $\\omega$ have the same radius, there exists a translation $\\Phi$ sending the former to the latter. Because $\\overline{AH}$ is parallel to the line connecting the centers of the two circles, $\\Phi$ must send $H$ to $A$ , meaning $\\Phi$ also sends $\\overline{XY}$ to the tangent to $\\omega$ at $A$ . But this means that this tangent is parallel to $\\overline{XY}$ , which implies the conclusion.\n\nApplying Stewart's Theorem to $\\triangle AXY$ yields \\[AX^2 = AH^2 + HX\\cdot HY = 3^2 + 2\\cdot 6 = 21,\\] implying $AX = AY= \\sqrt{21}.$\n\nBy the Law of Cosines \\[\\cos \\angle XAY = \\frac{21 + 21 - 64}{2 \\cdot 21} = -\\frac{11}{21},\\] so \\[\\sin \\angle XAY = \\dfrac{4\\sqrt{20}}{21}.\\] Let $R$ be the radius of $\\omega$ . By the Extended Law of Sines \\[R = \\frac{XY}{2 \\cdot \\sin \\angle XAY} = \\dfrac{21}{\\sqrt{20}}.\\] Then the solution proceeds as in Solution 3.\n\nSolution 5 (Official MAA 3):\nDefine points $D$ and $P$ as above, and note that $AD=5$ and $DH=PD=AD - AH = 2$ . Let the circumcircle of $\\triangle BCH$ be $\\omega'$ .\n\nExtend $\\overline{XY}$ past $X$ until it intersects line $BC$ at point $Z$ . Because line $BC$ is a radical axis of $\\omega$ and $\\omega'$ , it follows from the Power of a Point Theorem that \\[ZX \\cdot ZY = ZX \\cdot(ZX + 8) = ZH^2 = (ZX+2)^2,\\] from which $ZX=1$ . By Pythagorean Theorem $ZD=\\sqrt{ZH^2 - DH^2} = \\sqrt{5}$ .\n\nLet $m=CD$ and $n=BD$ . By the Power of a Point Theorem \\[mn= AD\\cdot PD = 10.\\] On the other hand, \\[ZH^2 = 9 = ZB \\cdot ZC = (\\sqrt{5} - n)(\\sqrt{5} + m) = 5 + \\sqrt{5}(m-n) - mn,\\] from which $m-n = \\frac{14}{\\sqrt{5}}$ . Therefore\n\n\\[(m+n)^2 = (m-n)^2 + 4mn = \\frac{196}{5} + 40 = \\frac{396}{5}.\\] Thus $BC = m+n=\\sqrt{\\frac{396}{5}} = 6\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{5}}$ . Therefore $[\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{1}{2}BC \\cdot AD = 3\\sqrt{55},$ as above.\n\nSolution 6:\nAIME-I-2020-15.png\n\nLet $O$ be circumcenter of $ABC,$ let $R$ be circumradius of $ABC,$ let $\\omega'$ be the image of circle $\\omega$ over line $BC$ (the circumcircle of $HBC$ ).\n\nLet $P$ be the image of the reflection of $H$ over line $BC, P$ lies on circle $\\omega.$ Let $M$ be the midpoint of $XY.$ Then $P$ lies on $\\omega, OA = O'H, OA || O'H.$\n\n(see here: https://brilliant.org/wiki/triangles-orthocenter/ or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_(triangle) Russian)\n\n$P$ lies on $\\omega \\implies OA = OP = R,$\n\n$OA = O'H, OA || O'H \\implies M$ lies on $OA.$\n\nWe use properties of crossing chords and get \\[AH \\cdot HP = XH \\cdot HY = 2 \\cdot 6 \\implies HP = 4, AP = AH + HP = 7.\\] We use properties of radius perpendicular chord and get \\[MH = \\frac{XH + HY}{2} – HY = 2.\\] We find \\[\\sin OAH =\\frac{MH}{AH} = \\frac{2}{3}  \\implies  \\cos OAH = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}.\\] We use properties of isosceles $\\triangle OAP$ and find $\\hspace{5mm}R = \\frac{AP}{2\\cos OAP} = \\frac{7}{2\\frac {\\sqrt{5}}{3}} = \\frac{21}{2\\sqrt{5}}.$\n\nWe use $OM' = \\frac{AH}{2} = \\frac {3}{2}$ and find $\\hspace{25mm} \\frac{BC}{2} = \\sqrt{R^2 – OM'^2} = 3 \\sqrt {\\frac {11}{5}}.$\n\nThe area of $ABC$ \\[[ABC]=\\frac{BC}{2} \\cdot (AH + HD) = 3\\cdot \\sqrt{55}  \\implies 3+55 = \\boldsymbol{\\boxed{058}}.\\] vladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss"}

Let $x = m^2$ . Therefore, we want two numbers, $x$ and $n$ , such that their product is $20^{20}$ and $x$ is a perfect square. Note that there is exactly one valid $n$ for a unique $x$ , which is $\\tfrac{20^{20}}{x}$ . This reduces the problem to finding the number of unique perfect square factors of $20^{20}$ .\n\n$20^{20} = 2^{40} \\cdot 5^{20} = \\left(2^2\\right)^{20}\\cdot\\left(5^2\\right)^{10}.$ Therefore, the answer is $21 \\cdot 11 = \\boxed{231}.$\n\n~superagh\n\n~TheBeast5520\n\nSolution 2 (Official MAA):\nBecause $20^{20}=2^{40}5^{20}$ , if $m^2n = 20^{20}$ , there must be nonnegative integers $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , and $d$ such that $m = 2^a5^b$ and $n = 2^c5^d$ . Then \\[2a + c = 40\\] and \\[2b+d = 20\\] The first equation has $21$ solutions corresponding to $a = 0,1,2,\\dots,20$ , and the second equation has $11$ solutions corresponding to $b = 0,1,2,\\dots,10$ . Therefore there are a total of $21\\cdot11 = \\boxed{231}$ ordered pairs $(m,n)$ such that $m^2n = 20^{20}$ ."}

Therefore, $(2^{\\frac{3}{100}})^n=3^{20}$ , and using the our first equation( $2^{xn}=3^{20}$ ), we get $x=\\frac{3}{100}$ and the answer is $\\boxed{103}$ .\n~rayfish\n\nSolution 2:\nBecause $\\log_a{b^c}=c\\log_a{b},$ we have that $20\\log_{2^x} 3 = 2020\\log_{2^{x+3}} 3,$ or $\\log_{2^x} 3 = 101\\log_{2^{x+3}} 3.$ Since $\\log_a{b}=\\dfrac{1}{\\log_b{a}},$ $\\log_{2^x} 3=\\dfrac{1}{\\log_{3} 2^x},$ and $101\\log_{2^{x+3}} 3=101\\dfrac{1}{\\log_{3}2^{x+3}},$ thus resulting in $\\log_{3}2^{x+3}=101\\log_{3} 2^x,$ or $\\log_{3}2^{x+3}=\\log_{3} 2^{101x}.$ We remove the base 3 logarithm and the power of 2 to yield $x+3=101x,$ or $x=\\dfrac{3}{100}.$\n\nOur answer is $\\boxed{3+100=103}.$ ~ OreoChocolate\n\nSolution 3 (Official MAA):\nUsing the Change of Base Formula to convert the logarithms in the given equation to base $2$ yields \\[\\frac{\\log_2 3^{20}}{\\log_2 2^x} = \\frac{\\log_2 3^{2020}}{\\log_2 2^{x+3}}, \\text{~ and then ~} \\frac{20\\log_2 3}{x\\cdot\\log_2 2} = \\frac{2020\\log_2 3}{(x+3)\\log_2 2}.\\] Canceling the logarithm factors then yields \\[\\frac{20}x = \\frac{2020}{x+3},\\] which has solution $x = \\frac3{100}.$ The requested sum is $3 + 100 = 103$ .\n\nSolution 4:\n$\\log_{2^x} 3^{20} = 2^{xy} = 3^{20}$\n\n$\\log_{2^{x+3}} 3^{2020} = (2^{x+3})^y = 3^{2020}$\n\n$3^{2020} = (3^{20})^{101}$\n\n$(2^{xy})^{101} = (2^{x+3})^y = 3^{2020}$\n\n$(2^{xy})^{101} = (2^{x+3})^y \\Rightarrow 2^{101xy} = 2^{xy+3y} \\Rightarrow 101xy = xy + 3y \\Rightarrow 101xy = y(x+3)$\n\n$101x = x + 3$\n\n$100x = 3$\n\n$x = \\frac{3}{100}$\n\n$100 + 3 = \\boxed{103}$ ~Airplanes2007"}

For any point $(x,y)$ not at the origin, the line segments from $(0,0)$ to $(x,y)$ and from $(x,y)$ to $(x-y,y+x)$ are perpendicular and are the same length. Thus a $90^\\circ$ clockwise rotation around the point $(x,y)$ sends the point $A(0,0)$ to the point $(x-y,y+x) = A'(24,18)$ . This has the solution $(x,y) = (21,-3)$ .

Note that $PC=PC'$ because $P$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $CC'$ (it must be equidistant from $C$ and $C'$ by properties of a rotation).\n\nSince $AB$ is vertical while $A'B'$ is horizontal, we have that the angle of rotation must be $90^{\\circ}$ , and therefore $\\angle P = 90^{\\circ}$ . Therefore, $CPC'$ is a 45-45-90 right triangle, and $CD=DP$ .\n\nWe calculate $D$ to be $(20,1)$ . Since we translate $4$ right and $1$ up to get from point $C$ to point $D$ , we must translate $1$ right and $4$ down to get to point $P$ . This gives us $P(21,-3)$ . Our answer is then $90+21-3=\\boxed{108}$ . ~Lopkiloinm & samrocksnature\n\nSolution 4:\nFor the above reasons, the transformation is simply a $90^\\circ$ rotation. Proceed with complex numbers on the points $C$ and $C'$ . Let $(x, y)$ be the origin. Thus, $C \\rightarrow (16-x)+(-y)i$ and $C' \\rightarrow (24-x)+(2-y)i$ . The transformation from $C'$ to $C$ is a multiplication of $i$ , which yields $(16-x)+(-y)i=(y-2)+(24-x)i$ . Equating the real and complex terms results in the equations $16-x=y-2$ and $-y=24-x$ . Solving, $(x, y) : (21, -3) \\rightarrow 90+21-3=\\boxed{108}$\n\n~beastgert\n\nSolution 5:\nWe know that the rotation point $P$ has to be equidistant from both $A$ and $A'$ so it has to lie on the line that is on the midpoint of the segment $AA'$ and also the line has to be perpendicular to $AA'$ . Solving, we get the line is $y=\\frac{-4}{3}x+25$ . Doing the same for $B$ and $B'$ , we get that $y=-6x+123$ . Since the point $P$ of rotation must lie on both of these lines, we set them equal, solve and get: $x=21$ , $y=-3$ . We can also easily see that the degree of rotation is $90$ since $AB$ is initially vertical, and now it is horizontal. Also, we can just sketch this on a coordinate plane and easily realize the same. Hence, the answer is $21-3+90 = \\boxed{108}$\n\nSolution 6:\n2020 AIME II 4.png\n\nWe make transformation of line $AB$ into line $A'B'$ using axes symmetry. Point $D(0,18)$ is the crosspoint of this lines. Equation of line $DO$ is \\[x + y = 18.\\] $\\triangle ABC$ maps into $\\triangle A''B''C''$ where \\[A''(18,18), B''(6,18), C''(18,2).\\]\n\nWe make transform of the line $A''C''$ into line $A'C'$ using axes symmetry with respect to line \\[x  = \\frac {A'' + A'}{2} = \\frac {24 + 18}{2} = 21.\\] The composition of two axial symmetries is a rotation through an angle twice as large as the angle between the axes $(45^o)$ around the point of their intersection $O(21, – 3).$ \\[m + x + y = 90 + 21 – 3 = \\boxed {108}\\] .\n\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss\n\nSolution 7 (Matrix and Transformations):\nFor a matrix to rotate a figure on a coordinate plane by $m$ degrees, it is written as: $\\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}  cos(m^{\\circ}) & sin(m^{\\circ})  \\\\  -sin(m^{\\circ}) & cos(m^{\\circ})  \\\\  \\end{array} } \\right]$\n\nWe can translate the whole figure so that the centre of rotation is at $(0,0)$ , which is equivalent to subtracting $x$ and $y$ from all $x$ -coordinates and the $y$ -coordinates respectively of the given points.\n\nWe then record all the points $A$ , $B$ , $C$ in a matrix as follows: $\\left[ {\\begin{array}{ccc}  0-x & 0-x & 16-x  \\\\  0-y & 12-y & 0-y  \\\\  \\end{array} } \\right]$\n\nand all the points $A'$ , $B'$ , $C'$ in a matrix as follows: $\\left[ {\\begin{array}{ccc}  24-x & 36-x & 24-x  \\\\  18-y & 18-y & 2-y  \\\\  \\end{array} } \\right]$\n\nSince $\\triangle A'B'C'$ is a rotation around $(x,y)$ of $\\triangle ABC$ by $m^{\\circ}$ , by the left multiplication rule, we can equate that:\n\n$\\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}  cos(m^{\\circ}) & sin(m^{\\circ})  \\\\  -sin(m^{\\circ}) & cos(m^{\\circ})  \\\\  \\end{array} } \\right]$ $\\left[ {\\begin{array}{ccc}  0-x & 0-x & 16-x  \\\\  0-y & 12-y & 0-y  \\\\  \\end{array} } \\right]$ $=$ $\\left[ {\\begin{array}{ccc}  24-x & 36-x & 24-x  \\\\  18-y & 18-y & 2-y  \\\\  \\end{array} } \\right]$\n\nWe can obtain the follow equations: $\\begin{cases} -xcos(m^{\\circ})-ysin(m^{\\circ})=24-x \\\\ -xcos(m^{\\circ})-ysin(m^{\\circ})+12sin(m^{\\circ})=36-x \\\\ xsin(m^{\\circ})-ycos(m^{\\circ})=24-x \\end{cases}$\n\nFrom the first 2 equations, we get $m=90$ , substituting into the 3rd equation, we get $x+y=18$ .\n\nTherefore, $m+x+y=90+18=\\boxed{108}$\n\n~VitalsBat\n\nSolution 8:\nIt is clear that $\\bigtriangleup CPC'$ is a $45-45-90$ right triangle so $m=90$ . We use the $\\tan$ angle formula, $\\tan{(a-b)}=\\frac{\\tan(a)-\\tan(b)}{1+\\tan(a)\\tan(b)}$ to find the slope of line $CP$ . We know that line $CC'$ has slope $\\frac{1}{4}$ and let $b=-45^{\\circ}$ , then plugging both values into the formula, we find that the slope of $CP$ is $\\frac{-3}{5}$ . Also, $CC'$ has length $\\sqrt{34}$ . Create a right triangle $KCP$ where $KP$ is parallel to the $x$ axis and $CP$ is the hypotenuse. Then $CK=3x$ and $KP=5x$ and doing Pythagorean on $\\bigtriangleup KCP$ gives $x=1$ . Therefore, we know that $P$ is a translation 3 units down and 5 units right from $C(16,0)$ , from which we obtain $P(21,-3)$ . Adding the three variables, we obtain $90+21-3=\\boxed{108}$\n\n~ Magnetoninja"}

The minimum base-sixteen representation of $g(n)$ that cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$ is $A_{16}$ , which is equal to $10$ in base 10.  Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-eight representation of the sum of the digits of $f(n)$ is $10$ .  The minimum value for which this is achieved is $37_8$ .  We have that $37_8 = 31$ .  Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-four representation of $n$ is $31$ .  The minimum value for which this is achieved is $13,333,333,333_4$ .  We just need this value in base 10 modulo 1000.  We get $13,333,333,333_4 = 3(1 + 4 + 4^2 + \\dots + 4^8 + 4^9) + 4^{10} = 3\\left(\\dfrac{4^{10} - 1}{3}\\right) + 4^{10} = 2*4^{10} - 1$ .  Taking this value modulo $1000$ , we get the final answer of $\\boxed{151}$ .  (If you are having trouble with this step, note that $2^{10} = 1024 \\equiv 24 \\pmod{1000}$ ) ~ TopNotchMath\n\nSolution 2 (Official MAA):\nFirst note that if $h_b(s)$ is the least positive integer whose digit sum, in some fixed base $b$ , is $s$ , then $h_b$ is a strictly increasing function. This together with the fact that $g(N) \\ge 10$ shows that $f(N)$ is the least positive integer whose base-eight digit sum is 10. Thus $f(N) = 37_\\text{eight} = 31$ , and $N$ is the least positive integer whose base-four digit sum is $31.$ Therefore \\[N = 13333333333_\\text{four} = 2\\cdot4^{10} - 1 = 2\\cdot1024^2 - 1\\] \\[\\equiv 2\\cdot24^2 - 1 \\equiv 151 \\pmod{1000}.\\]"}

Then, we have $s_n=\\frac{s_{n-1}+1}{s_{n-2}}$ where $s_1 = 100$ and $s_2 = 105$ . By substitution, we find $s_3 = \\frac{53}{50}$ , $s_4=\\frac{103}{105\\cdot50}$ , $s_5=\\frac{101}{105}$ , $s_6=100$ , and $s_7=105$ . So $s_n$ has a period of $5$ . Thus $s_{2020}=s_5=\\frac{101}{105}$ . So, $\\frac{101}{105\\cdot 5}\\implies 101+525=\\boxed{626}$ .\n~mn28407\n\nSolution 2 (Official MAA):\nMore generally, let the first two terms be $a$ and $b$ and replace $5$ and $25$ in the recursive formula by $k$ and $k^2$ , respectively. Then some algebraic calculation shows that \\[t_3 = \\frac{b\\,k+1}{a\\, k^2},~~t_4 = \\frac{a\\, k + b\\,k+1}{a\\,b\\, k^3},~~ t_5 = \\frac{a\\,k+1}{b\\, k^2},~~ t_6 = a, \\text{~ and ~}t_7 =b,\\] so the sequence is periodic with period $5$ . Therefore \\[t_{2020} = t_{5} =  \\frac{20\\cdot 5 +1}{21\\cdot  25} = \\frac{101}{525}.\\] The requested sum is $101+525=626$ .\n\nSolution 3:\nLet us examine the first few terms of this sequence and see if we can find a pattern. We are obviously given $t_1 = 20$ and $t_2 = 21$ , so now we are able to determine the numerical value of $t_3$ using this information: \\[t_3 = \\frac{5t_{3-1}+1}{25t_{3-2}} = \\frac{5t_{2}+1}{25t_{1}} = \\frac{5(21) + 1}{25(20)} = \\frac{105 + 1}{500}t_3 = \\frac{106}{500}  = \\frac{53}{250}\\] \\[t_4 = \\frac{5t_{4-1}+1}{25t_{4-2}} = \\frac{5t_{3}+1}{25t_{2}} = \\frac{5(\\frac{53}{250}) + 1}{25(21)} = \\frac{\\frac{53}{50} + 1}{525} = \\frac{\\frac{103}{50}}{525} = \\frac{103}{26250}\\] \\[t_5 = \\frac{5t_{5-1}+1}{25t_{5-2}} = \\frac{5t_{4}+1}{25t_{3}} = \\frac{5(\\frac{103}{26250}) + 1}{25(\\frac{53}{250})} = \\frac{\\frac{103}{5250} + 1}{\\frac{53}{10}} = \\frac{\\frac{5353}{5250}}{\\frac{53}{10}} = \\frac{101}{525}\\] \\[t_6 = \\frac{5t_{6-1}+1}{25t_{6-2}} = \\frac{5t_{5}+1}{25t_{4}} = \\frac{5(\\frac{101}{525}) + 1}{25(\\frac{103}{26250})} = \\frac{\\frac{101}{105} + 1}{\\frac{103}{1050}} = \\frac{\\frac{206}{105}}{\\frac{103}{1050}} \\implies t_6 = 20\\]\n\nAlas, we have figured this sequence is period 5! But since $2020 \\equiv 5 \\pmod 5$ , we can state that $t_{2020} = t_5 = \\frac{101}{525}$ . According to the original problem statement, our answer is $\\boxed{626}$ . ~ nikenissan"}

The sphere with maximum radius will be tangent to the sides of each of the cones. The center of that sphere must be on the axis of symmetry of each of the cones and thus must be at the intersection of their axes of symmetry. Let $A$ be the point in the cross section where the bases of the cones meet, and let $C$ be the center of the sphere. Let the axis of symmetry of one of the cones extend from its vertex, $B$ , to the center of its base, $D$ . Let the sphere be tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $E$ . The right triangles $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle CBE$ are similar, implying that the radius of the sphere is \\[CE = AD \\cdot\\frac{BC}{AB} = AD \\cdot\\frac{BD-CD}{AB} =3\\cdot\\frac5{\\sqrt{8^2+3^2}} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{73}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{225}{73}}.\\] The requested sum is $225+73=298$ . [asy] unitsize(0.6cm); pair A = (0,0);  pair TriangleOneLeft = (-6,0);  pair TriangleOneDown = (-3,-8);  pair TriangleOneMid = (-3,0);  pair D = (0,-3);  pair TriangleTwoDown = (0,-6);  pair B = (-8,-3);  pair C = IP(TriangleOneMid -- TriangleOneDown, B--D); pair EE = foot(C, A, B);  real radius = arclength(C--EE);  path circ = Circle(C, radius);    draw(A--B--TriangleTwoDown--cycle); draw(B--D);  draw(A--TriangleOneLeft--TriangleOneDown--cycle);  draw(circ);  draw(C--EE);  draw(TriangleOneMid -- TriangleOneDown, gray);  dot(\"$B$\", B, W);  dot(\"$E$\", EE, NW);  dot(\"$A$\", A, NE);  dot(\"$D$\", D, E);  dot(\"$C$\", C, SE); [/asy]\n\nNot part of MAA's solution, but this: https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/xv4nm97a is a good visual of the cones in GeoGebra.\n\nSolution (Incircles + Coordinate Bash):\n[asy] unitsize(0.6cm);  // Coordinates pair A = (0,0); pair B = (6,0); pair C = (0,6);  // Calculate point C pair D = (3,8); pair E = (8,3); pair F = (144/73,384/73);  // Draw triangles (cones) draw(A--B--D--cycle); draw(A--C--E--cycle); draw(incircle(A,E,F)); pair EE = foot(C, A, B);  real radius = arclength(C--EE);  path circ = Circle(C, radius);  // Label points dot(\"$A$\", A, NW); dot(\"$B$\", B, SW); dot(\"$C$\", C, NE); dot(\"$D$\", D, SE); dot(\"$E$\", E, SE); dot(\"$F$\", F, NE); [/asy]\n\nLet $A$ be the origin in the above diagram. Then $B$ is $(6,0)$ , $C$ is $(0,6)$ , $D$ is $(3,8)$ , and $E$ is $(8,3)$ .  Also, it is easy to see that the inscribed sphere is simply the inscribed circle of $AEF$ . Then we want to find the intersection of $AD$ and $CE$ to determine the coordinates of point $F$ . Note that $AD$ is line $y=\\frac{8}{3}x$ , and $CE$ is line $y=-\\frac{3}{8}x+6$ . Then, you can see that these lines are perpendicular, indicating that $AEF$ is a right triangle with right angle at $F$ . Finding the intersection of the lines by solving the system, we get that $F$ is the point $(\\frac{144}{73},\\frac{384}{73})$ in this plane. Then, we can find the distances $EF$ and $AF$ by the distance formula, which are $\\frac{55}{\\sqrt{73}}$ and $\\frac{48}{\\sqrt{73}}$ respectively. Also, $AE=\\sqrt{73}$ . Then, to find the radius of this triangle's incircle, we use the formula $a=rs$ from which we get that $r=\\frac{15}{\\sqrt{73}}$ and $r^2=\\frac{225}{73} \\implies \\boxed{298}$ is the answer.\n\n~SirAppel\n\nSolution (Clean analytic geometry):\nUsing the diagram above, we notice that the desired length is simply the distance between the point $C$ and $\\overline{AB}$ . We can mark $C$ as $(3,3)$ since it is $3$ units away from each of the bases. Point $B$ is $(8,3)$ . Thus, line $\\overline{AB}$ is $y = \\frac{3}{8}x \\Rightarrow 3x + 8y = 0$ . We can use the distance from point to line formula $\\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}$ , where $x_0$ and $y_0$ are the coordinates of the point, and A, B, and C are the coefficients of the line in form $Ax + By + C = 0$ . Plugging everything in, we get \\[\\frac{|3(3) - 8(3)|}{\\sqrt{8^2 + 3^2}} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{73}} \\Rightarrow \\frac{225}{73} \\Rightarrow \\boxed{298}\\] .\n\nSolution 1: Graph paper coordbash:\nWe graph this on graph paper, with the scale of $\\sqrt{2}:1$ . So, we can find $OT$ then divide by $\\sqrt{2}$ to convert to our desired units, then square the result. With 5 minutes' worth of coordbashing, we finally arrive at $298$ .\n\n[asy]  /* Geogebra to Asymptote conversion by samrocksnature, documentation at artofproblemsolving.com/Wiki go to User:Azjps/geogebra */ real labelscalefactor = 0.5; /* changes label-to-point distance */ pen dps = linewidth(0.7) + fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps); /* default pen style */  pen dotstyle = black; /* point style */  real xmin = -8.325025958411356, xmax = 8, ymin = -0.6033105644019334, ymax = 12.237120576121757;  /* image dimensions */ pen zzttqq = rgb(0.6,0.2,0); pen qqwuqq = rgb(0,0.39215686274509803,0); pen cqcqcq = rgb(0.7529411764705882,0.7529411764705882,0.7529411764705882);   draw((5,11)--(0,0)--(-6,6)--cycle, linewidth(1) + zzttqq);  draw((6,6)--(-5,11)--(0,0)--cycle, linewidth(1) + qqwuqq);  draw((0.2328977836854361,5.767102216314564)--(0.4657955673708722,6)--(0.2328977836854361,6.232897783685436)--(0,6)--cycle, linewidth(1) + qqwuqq);   /* draw grid of horizontal/vertical lines */ pen gridstyle = linewidth(0.7) + cqcqcq; real gridx = 1, gridy = 1; /* grid intervals */ for(real i = ceil(xmin/gridx)*gridx; i <= floor(xmax/gridx)*gridx; i += gridx)  draw((i,ymin)--(i,ymax), gridstyle); for(real i = ceil(ymin/gridy)*gridy; i <= floor(ymax/gridy)*gridy; i += gridy)  draw((xmin,i)--(xmax,i), gridstyle);  /* end grid */   Label laxis; laxis.p = fontsize(10);  xaxis(xmin, xmax, Ticks(laxis, Step = 1, Size = 2, NoZero),EndArrow(6), above = true);  yaxis(ymin, ymax, Ticks(laxis, Step = 1, Size = 2, NoZero),EndArrow(6), above = true); /* draws axes; NoZero hides '0' label */   /* draw figures */ draw((5,11)--(0,0), linewidth(1) + zzttqq);  draw((0,0)--(-6,6), linewidth(1) + zzttqq);  draw((-6,6)--(5,11), linewidth(1) + zzttqq);  draw((6,6)--(-5,11), linewidth(1) + qqwuqq);  draw((-5,11)--(0,0), linewidth(1) + qqwuqq);  draw((0,0)--(6,6), linewidth(1) + qqwuqq);  draw((-3,3)--(5,11), linewidth(1));  draw((-5,11)--(3,3), linewidth(1));  draw(circle((0,6), 2.482817665807104), linewidth(1));  draw((0,6)--(2.2602739726027394,4.972602739726027), linewidth(1));   /* dots and labels */ dot((0,0),linewidth(1pt) + dotstyle);  dot((3,3),dotstyle);  dot((-3,3),dotstyle);  dot((6,6),dotstyle);  dot((-6,6),dotstyle);  dot((5,11),dotstyle);  dot((-5,11),dotstyle);  dot((0,6),linewidth(1pt) + dotstyle);  label(\"$O$\", (0.059294254264342997,6.119672124650978), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((2.2602739726027394,4.972602739726027),linewidth(1pt) + dotstyle);  label(\"$T$\", (2.326166015469254,5.094921876435061), NE * labelscalefactor);  clip((xmin,ymin)--(xmin,ymax)--(xmax,ymax)--(xmax,ymin)--cycle);   /* end of picture */ [/asy]\n\n~samrocksnature\n\nSolution 2:\nUsing the graph drawn above in MAA solution, we see that $\\sqrt{AC^2-r^2}$ + $\\sqrt{BC^2-r^2}$ = $AB$ . $AB$ = $\\sqrt{8^2+3^2}$ = $\\sqrt{73}$ , $AC$ = 3 $\\sqrt{2}$ , $AB$ = 5.

Suppose that it is true for $n = m-1 \\ge 1$ , and note that the zeros of $f_m$ are the solutions of $|x - m| = k$ , where $k$ is a nonnegative zero of $f_{m-1}$ . Because the zeros of $f_{m-1}$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $2,$ so do the zeros of $f_m$ . The greatest zero of $f_{m-1}$ is \\[m-1+\\frac{(m-1)(m-2)}2 =\\frac{m(m-1)}2,\\] so the greatest zero of $f_m$ is $m+\\frac{m(m-1)}2$ and the least is $m-\\frac{m(m-1)}2$ .\n\nIt follows that the number of zeros of $f_n$ is $\\frac{n(n-1)}2+1=\\frac{n^2-n+2}2$ , and their average value is $n$ . The sum of the zeros of $f_n$ is \\[\\frac{n^3-n^2+2n}2.\\] Let $S(n)=n^3-n^2+2n$ , so the sum of the zeros exceeds $500{,}000$ if and only if $S(n) > 1{,}000{,}000 = 100^3\\!.$ Because $S(n)$ is increasing for $n > 2$ , the values $S(100) = 1{,}000{,}000 - 10{,}000 + 200 = 990{,}200$ and $S(101)=1{,}030{,}301 - 10{,}201 + 202 = 1{,}020{,}302$ show that the requested value of $n$ is $\\boxed{101}$ .\n\nSolution 2 (Same idea, easier to see):\nStarting from $f_1(x)=|x-1|$ , we can track the solutions, the number of solutions, and their sum:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} n&Solutions&number&sum\\\\  1&1&1&1\\\\   2&1,3&2&4\\\\    3&0,2,4,6&4&12\\\\ 4&-2,0,2...10&7&28\\\\ 5&-5,-3,-1...15&11&55\\\\ \\end{array}\\]\n\nIt is clear that the solutions form arithmetic sequences with a difference of 2, and the negative solutions cancel out all but $n$ of the $1+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ solutions. Thus, the sum of the solutions is $n \\cdot [1+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}]$ , which is a cubic function.\n(Side Note: Gergor-Newton Interpolation Formula is applicable here)\n\n$n \\cdot [1+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}]>500,000$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $2$ ,\n\n$n \\cdot [2+n(n-1)]>1,000,000$\n\n1 million is $10^6=100^3$ , so the solution should be close to $100$ .\n\n100 is slightly too small, so $\\boxed{101}$ works.\n\n~ dragnin"}

Since we don't really want to think that hard, and bashing does not take that long for this problem, we can write down half of all permutations that satisfy the conditions presented in the problem in \"lexicographically next\" order to keep track easily. We do this for all cases such that the first \"person\" is $A-C$ , and multiply by two, since the number of working permutations with $D-F$ as the first person is the same as if it were $A-C$ , hence, after doing such a bash, we get $45\\times2=90$ permutations that result in no consecutive letters being adjacent to each other.\n~afatperson\n\nSolution 2 (Official MAA):\nAyako ( $A$ ), Billy $(B)$ , Carlos $(C)$ , Dahlia $(D)$ , Ehuang $(E)$ , and Frank $(F)$ originally sat in the order $ABCDEF$ .\nLet $T(XY)$ denote the set of seatings where $X$ and $Y$ sit next to each other after the break. Then the required number of seating orders is given by the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle as \\[6!-\\big(|T(AB)|+|T(BC)|+|T(CD)|+|T(DE)|+|T(EF)|\\big)+\\] \\[\\big(|T(AB)\\cap T(BC)|+|T(AB)\\cap T(CD)|+\\cdots\\big) - \\cdots.\\] Each term can be calculated separately.\n\n(a) $|T(AB)|=|T(BC)|=|T(CD)|=|T(DE)|=|T(EF)|=2\\cdot5!=240.$ Because there are $5$ terms, the sum is $5\\cdot240=1200$ .\n\n(b) For $|T(XY)\\cap T(ZW)|$ , if $Y=Z$ , then $XYW$ must sit consecutively, so $|T(XY)\\cap T(ZW)|=2\\cdot4!=48$ . There are $4$ terms that satisfy $Y=Z$ , so the sum is $4\\cdot 48=192$ . If $XY$ and $ZW$ are pairwise disjoint, then $|T(XY)\\cap T(ZW)|=2^2\\cdot4!=96$ . There are $6$ terms, so the sum is $6\\cdot96=576$ .\n\n(c) If there are at least three pairs that sit next to each other, consider these three subcases:\nIf the three pairs are consecutive, the sum is $3\\cdot2\\cdot3!=36$ .\nIf exactly two of the pairs are consecutive, the sum is $6\\cdot2^2\\cdot3!=144$ .\nIf none of the three pairs is consecutive, the sum is $1\\cdot2^3\\cdot3!=48.$\n\n(d) If there are at least four pairs that sit next to each other, then if the pairs are consecutive, the sum is $2\\cdot2\\cdot2!=8$ . If the pairs are not consecutive, then the sum is $3\\cdot2^2\\cdot2!=24$ .\n\n(e) If all five pairs sit next to each other, the number is $1\\cdot2\\cdot1!=2$ .\n\nTherefore the required number of seating orders is \\[6!-1200+(192+576)-{(36+144+48)+(8+24)-2}=90.\\]\n\nNote: See the A002464 of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for equivalent formulations.\n\nSolution 3:\nWe proceed with casework based on the person who sits first after the break.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1:}$ A is first. Then the first three people in the row can be ACE, ACF, ADB, ADF, AEB, AEC, AFB, AFC, or AFD, which yield 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, and 1 possible configurations, respectively, implying 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 12 possible configurations in this case.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2:}$ B is first. Then the first three people in the row can be BDA, BDF, BEA, BEC, BFA, BFC, or BFD, which yield 2, 4, 2, 4, 0, 1, and 2 possible configurations, respectively, implying 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 15 possible configurations in this case.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 3:}$ C is first. Then the first three people in the row can be CAD, CAE, CAF, CEA, CEB, CFA, CFB, or CFD, which yield 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 2, 2, and 2 possible configurations, respectively, implying 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18 possible configurations in this case.\n\nFinally, the number of valid configurations for A and F, B and E, and C and D are equal by symmetry, so our final answer is 2(12 + 15 + 18), which computes to be $\\boxed{090}.$ ~peace09\n\nSolution 4:\nWe determine the order of A, B, C, relative to each other. Then, we will insert D, E, F into the alignment and calculate the total number of possibilities. This solution can be visualised as standing in lines rather than sitting on chairs.\n\nThere are 6 possible alignments for A, B, and C, but we only evaluate 3 because the other 3 cases can be mirrored to overlap these 3 cases.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1: A B C}$ In this case, there must be a person standing between A and B and also between B and C. Also, D cannot be adjacent to C. There are 9 possibilities.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2: A C B}$ In this case, there must be a person standing between B and C. Also, D cannot be adjacent to C. There are 12 possibilities.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 3: C A B}$ In this case, there must be a person standing between A and B. Also, D cannot be adjacent to C. There are 24 possibilities.\n\nSo the total number of cases is 2(9+12+24)= $\\boxed{090}$ .\n\n-Superdolphin\n\nSolution 5 (Recursion, taking less time):\nConsider arrangements of numbers $1, 2, 3, ..., n$ .\n\nLet $f(n,k)$ be the number of arrangements in which $1$ and $2$ , $2$ and $3$ , $3$ and $4$ , ..., $k-1$ and $k$ aren't together. We need to find $f(6,6)$ .\n\nLet $d(n,k)$ be the number of arrangements in which $1$ and $2$ , $2$ and $3$ , $3$ and $4$ , ..., $k-2$ and $k-1$ aren't together, but $(k-1)$ and $k$ are together.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[f(n,k+1) = f(n,k) - d(n,k+1)  ......(1)\\]\n\n\\[d(n,k+1) = 2f(n-1,k) + d(n-1,k)  ......(2)\\]\n\nHence, \\[f(n,k+1)=f(n,k)-f(n-1,k)-f(n-1,k-1)\\]\n\nAnd because $f(n,0) = f(n,1) = n!$ , it's easy to get $f(6,6) = \\boxed{090}$\n\n\\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\\hline k,n & n=1 & n=2 & n=3 & n=4 & n=5 & n=6\\\\\\hline k=1 & 1 & 2 & 6 & 24 & 120 & 720\\\\\\hline k=2 & & 0 & 2 & 12 & 72 & 480\\\\\\hline k=3 & & & 0 & 4 & 36 & 288\\\\\\hline k=4 & & & & 2 & 20 & 180\\\\\\hline k=5 & & & & & 14 & 124\\\\\\hline k=6 & & & & & & 90\\\\\\hline \\end{tabular}\\]\n\nNote: How to get the two equations (1) and (2).\n\n1. If $1$ and $2$ , $2$ and $3$ , ... , $k-1$ and $k$ aren't together, there are two cases:\n\n(a) $k$ and $k+1$ aren't together. There are $f(n,k+1)$ ways of arrangements.\n\n(b) $k$ and $k+1$ are together. There are $d(n,k+1)$ ways of arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n,k)=f(n,k+1)+d(n,k+1)$ , i.e. $f(n,k+1)=f(n,k)-d(n,k+1)$ , which is the first equation.\n\n2. If $1$ and $2$ , $2$ and $3$ , ... , $k-1$ and $k$ aren't together, but $k$ and $k+1$ are together, there are 2 cases :\n\n(a) $k-1$ isn't together with $k$ or $k+1$ . We first determine the order of $k$ and $k+1$ , then, we can treat them as one number since they should be always together. Hence, the number of arrangements is $2f(n-1,k)$ .\n\n(b) $k-1$ is together with $k$ or $k+1$ . We first determine the order of $k$ and $k+1$ , then  treat them as one \"super number\". Since $k-1$ is together with the \"super number\", there are $2d(n-1,k)$ ways of arrangements. However, $k-1$ can only be on one side of the \"super number\" because $k-1$ and $k$ aren't together, so we need to multiple a $1/2$ to the number of arrangements. Finally, there are $2d(n-1,k)*(1/2)=d(n-1,k)$ ways of arrangements.\n\nThus, $d(n,k+1)=2f(n-1,k)+d(n-1,k)$ , which is the second equation.\n\n~Shawn\n\nSolution 6 (fast):\nWe will split up our cases based on the positions of $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ relative to each other.\n\nCase $1$ : $A$ $B$ $C$ : $9$ cases\n\nCase $2$ : $A$ $C$ $B$ : $16$ cases\n\nCase $3$ : $B$ $A$ $C$ : $20$ cases\n\nSince we can reverse the first case to make $C$ $B$ $A$ , reverse the second case to make $B$ $C$ $A$ , and reverse the third case to make $C$ $A$ $B$ , by symmetry we have $2(9+16+20) = \\boxed{090}$ ways in total.\n\n~xHypotenuse"}

Then we have \\begin{align*} 1^3+2^3+3^3+\\dots+(m-5)^3&\\equiv 17 \\mod m \\\\ \\left(\\frac{(m-5)(m-4)}{2}\\right)^2&\\equiv 17 \\mod m \\\\ \\left(\\dfrac{m(m-9)+20}2\\right)^2&\\equiv 17\\mod m \\\\ \\left(m(m-9)+20\\right)^2&\\equiv 4\\cdot 17\\mod m \\\\ \\left(20\\right)^2&\\equiv 68\\mod m \\\\ 332 &\\equiv 0 \\mod m \\\\ \\end{align*} So, $m\\in\\{83,166,332\\}$ . Testing the cases, only $332$ fails. This leaves $78+161=\\boxed{239}$ .\n\n$\\LaTeX$ and formatting adjustments and intermediate steps for clarification by Technodoggo.\n\nSolution 2 (Official MAA 1):\nThe sum of the cubes from 1 to $n$ is \\[1^3+2^3+\\cdots+n^3=\\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}.\\] For this to be equal to $(n+5)q+17$ for some integer $q$ , it must be that \\[n^2(n+1)^2=4(n+5)q+4\\cdot 17,\\] so \\[n^2(n+1)^2 \\equiv 4 \\cdot 17= 68\\hskip-.2cm \\pmod{n+5}.\\] But $n^2(n+1)^2 \\equiv (-5)^2(-4)^2 = 400 \\pmod{n+5}.$ Thus $n^2(n+1)^2$ is congruent to both $68$ and $400,$ which implies that $n+5$ divides $400-68 = 332=2^2 \\cdot 83$ . Because $n+5 > 17$ , the only choices for $n+5$ are $83, 166,$ and $332.$ Checking all three cases verifies that $n=78$ and $n=161$ work, but $n=327$ does not. The requested sum is $78+161 = 239$ .\n\nSolution 3 (Official MAA 2):\nThe sum of the cubes of the integers from $1$ through $n$ is \\[1^3+2^3+\\cdots+n^3=\\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4},\\] which, when divided by $n+5$ , has quotient \\[Q=\\frac14n^3 -\\frac34n^2+4n-20 = \\frac{n^2(n-3)}4+4n-20\\] with remainder $100.$ If $n$ is not congruent to $1\\pmod4$ , then $Q$ is an integer, and \\[\\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} = (n+5)Q + 100 \\equiv 17\\pmod{n+5},\\] so $n+5$ divides $100 - 17 =83$ , and $n = 78$ . If $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod4$ , then $Q$ is half of an integer, and letting $n = 4k+1$ for some integer $k$ gives \\[\\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} = 2(2k+3)Q + 100 \\equiv 17\\pmod{n+5}.\\] Thus $2k+3$ divides $100-17 = 83$ . It follows that $k=40$ , and $n = 161$ . The requested sum is $161 + 78 = 239$ .\n\nSolution 4:\nUsing the formula for $\\sum_{k=1}^n  k^3$ , \\[1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ... + n^3 = \\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}\\] Since $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ... + n^3$ divided by $n + 5$ has a remainder of $17$ , \\[\\frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4} \\equiv 17\\pmod {n + 5}\\] Using the rules of modular arithmetic, \\[n^2(n+1)^2 \\equiv 68\\pmod {n + 5}\\] \\[n^2(n+1)^2 - 68\\equiv 0\\pmod {n + 5}\\] Expanding the left hand side, \\[n^4 + 2 n^3 + n^2 - 68\\equiv 0\\pmod {n + 5}\\] This means that $n^4 + 2 n^3 + n^2 - 68$ is divisible by ${n + 5}$ .\n\n\\[(n + 5) | (n^4 + 2 n^3 + n^2 - 68)\\] Dividing polynomials, \\[\\frac{n^4 + 2 n^3 + n^2 - 68}{n + 5}\\] \\[= n^3 - 3 n^2 + 16n - 80 + \\frac{332}{(n + 5)}\\] $(n + 5)$ $|$ $(n^4 + 2 n^3 + n^2 - 68)$ $\\iff$ $\\frac{332}{(n + 5)}$ $\\in$ $\\mathbb{Z}$ $\\frac{332}{(n + 5)}$ $\\in$ $\\mathbb{Z}$ $\\iff$ $(n + 5) = \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 83, \\pm 166, \\pm 332$ Note that $n$ $\\in$ $\\mathbb{N}$ and $n + 5 > 17$ (because the remainder when dividing by $n + 5$ is $17$ , so $n + 5$ must be greater than $17$ ), so all options $\\leq 17$ can be eliminated. \\[(n + 5) = 83, 166, 332\\] \\[n = 78, 161, 327\\] Checking all 3 cases, $n = 78$ and $n = 161$ work; $n = 327$ fails. Therefore, the answer is $78 + 161 = \\boxed{239}$ . ~ {TSun} ~\n\nSolution 5 (similar ideas to Solution 1, but faster):\nAs before, we note that $(5+a)^3 + (n-a)^3 \\equiv (5+a)^3 - (n+5 - (n-a))^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod {n+5}.$ Thus, we can pair up the terms from $5^3$ to $n^3$ and cancel them. We have to deal with two cases:\n\nIf $n$ is even, then $5^3+6^3 + \\cdots + n^3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod {n+5},$ as there are an even number of terms and they pair and cancel. We thus get $1^2+2^3+3^3+4^3 = 100 \\equiv 17 \\pmod {n+5},$ or $(n+5) | 83,$ which yields $n=78.$\n\nIf $n$ is odd, then $1^3+2^3+\\cdots + n^3 \\equiv 1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3+\\left( \\frac{n+5}{2} \\right)^3 \\equiv 17 \\pmod {n+5}.$ Letting $k = \\frac{n+5}{2}$ yields $k^2 + 83 \\equiv 0 \\pmod {2k}.$ However, this means that $83$ is divisible by $k,$ so $k=1,83.$ Plugging this back into $n$ yields $n=2(83)-5 = 161$ in the latter case.\n\nThus, the sum of all possible $n$ is just $78+161 = \\boxed{239}.$\n\n- ccx09"}

We can write the following: \\[P + Q = 2x^2 + (a - 3)x - 5\\] \\[P + R = 2x^2 + (b - 3)x + (c - 7)\\] \\[Q + R = 2x^2 + (a + b)x + (c + 2)\\] Let the common root of $P+Q,P+R$ be $r$ ; $P+R,Q+R$ be $s$ ; and $P+Q,Q+R$ be $t$ .  We then have that the roots of $P+Q$ are $r,t$ , the roots of $P + R$ are $r, s$ , and the roots of $Q + R$ are $s,t$ .\n\nBy Vieta's, we have: \\[r + t = \\dfrac{3 - a}{2}\\tag{1}\\] \\[r + s = \\dfrac{3 - b}{2}\\tag{2}\\] \\[s + t = \\dfrac{-a - b}{2}\\tag{3}\\] \\[rt = \\dfrac{-5}{2}\\tag{4}\\] \\[rs = \\dfrac{c - 7}{2}\\tag{5}\\] \\[st = \\dfrac{c + 2}{2}\\tag{6}\\]\n\nSubtracting $(3)$ from $(1)$ , we get $r - s = \\dfrac{3 + b}{2}$ .  Adding this to $(2)$ , we get $2r = 3 \\implies r = \\dfrac{3}{2}$ .  This gives us that $t = \\dfrac{-5}{3}$ from $(4)$ .  Substituting these values into $(5)$ and $(6)$ , we get $s = \\dfrac{c-7}{3}$ and $s = \\dfrac{-3c - 6}{10}$ .  Equating these values, we get $\\dfrac{c-7}{3} = \\dfrac{-3c-6}{10} \\implies c = \\dfrac{52}{19} = R(0)$ .  Thus, our answer is $52 + 19 = \\boxed{071}$ . ~ TopNotchMath\n\nSolution 2:\nWe know that $P(x)=x^2-3x-7$ .\n\nSince $Q(0)=2$ , the constant term in $Q(x)$ is $2$ .

Because $p$ and $q$ are both roots of $P+Q$ and $P+Q$ has leading coefficient $2$ , it follows that $P(x) + Q(x) = 2(x-p)(x-q).$ Similarly, $P(x) + R(x) = 2(x-p)(x-r)$ and $Q(x) + R(x) = 2(x-q)(x-r)$ . Adding these three equations together and dividing by $2$ yields \\[P(x) + Q(x) + R(x) = (x-p)(x-q) + (x-p)(x-r) + (x-q)(x-r),\\] so \\[P(x) = (P(x) + Q(x) + R(x)) - (Q(x) + R(x))\\] \\[= (x-p)(x-q) + (x-p)(x-r) - (x-q)(x-r)\\] \\[= x^2 - 2px + (pq + pr - qr).\\] Similarly, \\[Q(x) =  x^2 - 2qx + (pq + qr - pr) \\text{~ and}\\] \\[R(x) =  x^2 - 2rx + (pr + qr - pq).\\] Comparing the $x$ coefficients yields $p = \\tfrac32$ , and comparing the constant coefficients yields $-7 = pq + pr - qr = \\tfrac32(q+r) - qr$ . The fact that $Q(0) = 2$ implies that $\\tfrac32(q-r) + qr = 2$ . Adding these two equations yields $q = -\\tfrac53$ , and so substituting back in to solve for $r$ gives $r=-\\tfrac{27}{19}$ .

Since $m$ and $n$ are odds, and $200$ is in the top row and $2000$ in the bottom, $m$ has to be $3$ , $5$ , $7$ , or $9$ . Also, taking a look at the diagram, the slope of the line connecting those centers has to have an absolute value of $< 1$ . Therefore, $m < 1800 \\mod n < 1800-m$ .\n\nIf $m=3$ , $n$ can range from $667$ to $999$ . However, $900$ divides $1800$ , so looking at mods, we can easily eliminate $899$ and $901$ . Now, counting these odd integers, we get $167 - 2 = 165$ .\n\nSimilarly, let $m=5$ . Then $n$ can range from $401$ to $499$ . However, $450|1800$ , so one can remove $449$ and $451$ . Counting odd integers, we get $50 - 2 = 48$ .\n\nTake $m=7$ . Then, $n$ can range from $287$ to $333$ . However, $300|1800$ , so one can verify and eliminate $299$ and $301$ . Counting odd integers, we get $24 - 2 = 22$ .\n\nLet $m = 9$ . Then $n$ can vary from $223$ to $249$ . However, $225|1800$ . Checking that value and the values around it, we can eliminate $225$ . Counting odd integers, we get $14 - 1 = 13$ .\n\nAdd all of our cases to get \\[165+48+22+13 = \\boxed{248}\\]\n\n-Solution by thanosaops\n\nSolution 2 (Official MAA):\nBecause square $2000$ is in the bottom row, it follows that $\\frac{2000}m \\le n < \\frac{2000}{m-1}$ . Moreover, because square $200$ is in the top row, and square $2000$ is not in the top row, $1 < m \\le 10$ . In particular, because the number of rows in the rectangle must be odd, $m$ must be one of $3, 5, 7,$ or $9.$\n\nFor each possible choice of $m$ and $n$ , let $\\ell_{m,n}$ denote the line through the centers of squares $200$ and $2000.$ Note that for odd values of $m$ , the line $\\ell_{m,n}$ passes through the center of square $1100.$ Thus $\\ell_{m,n}$ intersects the interior of cell $1099$ exactly when its slope is strictly between $-1$ and $1$ . The line $\\ell_{m,n}$ is vertical whenever square $2000$ is the $200$ th square in the bottom row of the rectangle. This would happen for $m = 3, 5, 7, 9$ when $n = 900, 450, 300, 225$ , respectively. When $n$ is 1 greater than or 1 less than these numbers, the slope of $\\ell_{m,n}$ is $1$ or $-1$ , respectively. In all other cases the slope is strictly between $-1$ and $1.$ The admissible values for $n$ for each possible value of $m$ are given in the following table. \\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\\hline m & minimum n & maximum n & avoided n & number of odd n\\\\\\hline 3&667&999&899, 900, 901&165\\\\\\hline 5&400&499&449, 450, 451&48\\\\\\hline 7&286&333&299, 300, 301&22\\\\\\hline 9&223&249&224, 225, 226&13\\\\\\hline \\end{tabular}\\] This accounts for $165 + 48 + 22 + 13 = 248$ rectangles."}

Then let $PB=x=BQ=RD=SD$ , $ET=y=ES=CR=CQ$ , $AP=AT=z$ . So we have $x+y=6$ , $x+z=5$ and $y+z=7$ , solve it we have $x=2$ , $z=3$ , $y=4$ . Let the center of the incircle be $I$ , by SAS we can proof triangle $BIQ$ is congruent to triangle $DIS$ , and triangle $CIR$ is congruent to triangle $SIE$ . Then we have $\\angle AED=\\angle BCD$ , $\\angle ABC=\\angle CDE$ . Extend $CD$ , cross ray $AB$ at $M$ , ray $AE$ at $N$ , then by AAS we have triangle $END$ is congruent to triangle $BMC$ . Thus $\\angle M=\\angle N$ . Let $EN=MC=a$ , then $BM=DN=a+2$ . So by law of cosine in triangle $END$ and triangle $ANM$ we can obtain \\[\\frac{2a+8}{2(a+7)}=\\cos N=\\frac{a^2+(a+2)^2-36}{2a(a+2)}\\] , solved it gives us $a=8$ , which yield triangle $ANM$ to be a triangle with side length 15, 15, 24, draw a height from $A$ to $NM$ divides it into two triangles with side lengths 9, 12, 15, so the area of triangle $ANM$ is 108. Triangle $END$ is a triangle with side lengths 6, 8, 10, so the area of two of them is 48, so the area of pentagon is $108-48=\\boxed{60}$ .\n\n-Fanyuchen20020715\n\nSolution 2 (Complex Bash):\nSuppose that the circle intersects $\\overline{AB}$ , $\\overline{BC}$ , $\\overline{CD}$ , $\\overline{DE}$ , and $\\overline{EA}$ at $P$ , $Q$ , $R$ , $S$ , and $T$ respectively. Then $AT = AP = a$ , $BP = BQ = b$ , $CQ = CR = c$ , $DR = DS = d$ , and $ES = ET = e$ . So $a + b = 5$ , $b + c = 6$ , $c + d = 6$ , $d + e = 6$ , and $e + a = 7$ . Then $2a + 2b + 2c + 2d + 2e = 30$ , so $a + b + c + d + e= 15$ . Then we can solve for each individually. $a = 3$ , $b = 2$ , $c = 4$ , $d = 2$ , and $e = 4$ . To find the radius, we notice that $4 \\arctan(\\frac{2}{r}) + 4 \\arctan(\\frac{4}{r}) + 2 \\arctan (\\frac{3}{r}) = 360 ^ \\circ$ , or $2 \\arctan(\\frac{2}{r}) + 2 \\arctan(\\frac{4}{r}) + \\arctan (\\frac{3}{r}) = 180 ^ \\circ$ . Each of these angles in this could be represented by complex numbers. When two complex numbers are multiplied, their angles add up to create the angle of the resulting complex number. Thus, $(r + 2i)^2 \\cdot (r + 4i)^2 \\cdot (r + 3i)$ is real. Expanding, we get:\n\n\\[(r^2 + 4ir - 4)(r^2 + 8ir -16)(r + 3i)\\]\n\n\\[(r^4 + 12ir^3 - 52r^2 - 96ir + 64)(r + 3i)\\]\n\nOn the last expanding, we only multiply the reals with the imaginaries and vice versa, because we only care that the imaginary component equals 0.\n\n\\[15ir^4 - 252ir^2 + 192i = 0\\]\n\n\\[5r^4 - 84r^2 + 64 = 0\\]\n\n\\[(5r^2 - 4)(r^2 - 16) = 0\\]\n\n$r$ must equal 4, as r cannot be negative or be approximately equal to 1.\nThus, the area of $ABCDE$ is $4 \\cdot (a + b + c + d + e) = 4 \\cdot 15 = \\boxed{60}$\n\n-nihao4112\n\nSolution 3 (Guess 1):\nThis pentagon is very close to a regular pentagon with side lengths $6$ . The area of a regular pentagon with side lengths $s$ is $\\frac{5s^2}{4\\sqrt{5-2\\sqrt{5}}}$ . $5-2\\sqrt{5}$ is slightly greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$ given that $2\\sqrt{5}$ is slightly less than $\\frac{9}{2}$ . $4\\sqrt{5-2\\sqrt{5}}$ is then slightly greater than $2\\sqrt{2}$ . We will approximate that to be $2.9$ . The area is now roughly $\\frac{180}{2.9}$ , but because the actual pentagon is not regular, but has the same perimeter of the regular one that we are comparing to we can say that this is an overestimate on the area and turn the $2.9$ into $3$ thus turning the area into $\\frac{180}{3}$ which is $60$ and since $60$ is a multiple of the semiperimeter $15$ , we can safely say that the answer is most likely $\\boxed{60}$ .\n\n~Lopkiloinm\n\nSolution 4 (Guess 2):\nBecause the AIME answers have to be a whole number it would meant the radius of the circle have to be a whole number, thus by drawing the diagram and experimenting, we can safely say the radius is 4 and the answer is 60\n\n(Edit: While the guess would be technically correct, the assumption that the radius would have to be a whole number for the ans to be a whole number is wrong)\n\nBy EtherealMidnight\n\n(Edit: I think that will actually work because the area of $ABCDE$ is equal to the semi-perimeter times the radius. By a simple calculation, we know that the semi-perimeter is an integer so the radius should also be an integer)\n\nBy YBSuburbanTea\n\n...the radius could be a fraction with denominator 3, 5, or 15, and the area of the pentagon would still be an integer. - GeometryJake\n\nSolution 5 (Official MAA 1):\nLet $\\omega$ be the inscribed circle, $I$ be its center, and $r$ be its radius. The area of $ABCDE$ is equal to its semiperimeter, $15,$ times $r$ , so the problem is reduced to finding $r$ . Let $a$ be the length of the tangent segment from $A$ to $\\omega$ , and analogously define $b$ , $c$ , $d$ , and $e$ . Then $a+b=5$ , $b+c= c+d=d+e=6$ , and $e+a=7$ , with a total of $a+b+c+d+e=15$ . Hence $a=3$ , $b=d=2$ , and $c=e=4$ . It follows that $\\angle B= \\angle D$ and $\\angle C= \\angle E$ . Let $Q$ be the point where $\\omega$ is tangent to $\\overline{CD}$ . Then $\\angle IAE = \\angle IAB =\\frac{1}{2}\\angle A$ . Now we claim that points $A, I, Q$ are collinear, which can be proved if $\\angle{AIQ}=\\angle{QIA}=180^{\\circ}$ . The sum of the internal angles in polygons $ABCQI$ and $AIQDE$ are equal, so $\\angle IAE + \\angle AIQ + \\angle IQD + \\angle D + \\angle E = \\angle IAB + \\angle B + \\angle C + \\angle CQI + \\angle QIA$ , which implies that $\\angle AIQ$ must be $180^\\circ$ . Therefore points $A$ , $I$ , and $Q$ are collinear.

Note that $\\tan \\left(\\frac{\\angle B}{2}\\right) = \\frac{r}{2}$ and $\\tan \\left(\\frac{\\angle E}{2}\\right) = \\frac{r}{4}$ , so \\[\\cos (\\angle B) =\\frac{1-\\tan^2 \\left(\\frac{\\angle B}{2}\\right)}{1+\\tan^2 \\left(\\frac{\\angle B}{2}\\right)} =  \\frac{4-r^2}{4+r^2}\\] and \\[\\cos (\\angle E) = \\frac{1-\\tan^2 \\left(\\frac{\\angle E}{2}\\right)}{1+\\tan^2 \\left(\\frac{\\angle E}{2}\\right)}= \\frac{16-r^2}{16+r^2}.\\] Applying the Law of Cosines to $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle AED$ gives \\[AC^2=AB^2+BC^2-2\\cdot AB\\cdot BC\\cdot \\cos (\\angle B) = 5^2+6^2-2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\frac{4-r^2}{4+r^2}\\] and \\[AD^2=AE^2+DE^2-2 \\cdot AE \\cdot DE \\cdot \\cos(\\angle E) = 7^2+6^2-2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\frac{16-r^2}{16+r^2}.\\] Hence\n\n\\[12=AC^2- AD^2= 5^2-2\\cdot 5 \\cdot 6\\cdot \\frac{4-r^2}{4+r^2} -7^2+2\\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\frac{16-r^2}{16+r^2},\\] yielding \\[2\\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\frac{16-r^2}{16+r^2}- 2\\cdot 5 \\cdot 6\\cdot \\frac{4-r^2}{4+r^2}= 36;\\] equivalently \\[7(16-r^2)(4+r^2)-5(4-r^2)(16+r^2) = 3(16+r^2)(4+r^2).\\] Substituting $x=r^2$ gives the quadratic equation $5x^2-84x+64=0$ , with solutions $\\frac{42 - 38}{5}=\\frac45$ , and $\\frac{42 + 38}{5}= 16$ . The solution $r^2=\\frac45$ corresponds to a five-pointed star, which is not convex. Indeed, if $r<3$ , then $\\tan \\left(\\frac{\\angle A}{2}\\right)$ , $\\tan \\left(\\frac{\\angle C}{2}\\right)$ , and $\\tan \\left(\\frac{\\angle E}{2}\\right)$ are less than $1,$ implying that $\\angle A$ , $\\angle C$ , and $\\angle E$ are acute, which cannot happen in a convex pentagon. Thus $r^2=16$ and $r=4$ . The requested area is $15\\cdot4 = \\boxed{60}$ .\n\nSolution 6 (Official MAA 2):\nDefine $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , $d$ , $e$ , and $r$ as in Solution 5. Then, as in Solution 5, $a=3$ , $b=d=2$ , $c=e=4$ , $\\angle B= \\angle D$ , and $\\angle C= \\angle E$ . Let $\\alpha =\\frac{\\angle A}{2}$ , $\\beta = \\frac{\\angle B}{2}$ , and $\\gamma=\\frac{\\angle C}{2}$ . It follows that $540^{\\circ} = 2\\alpha + 4 \\beta + 4 \\gamma$ , so $270^{\\circ} = \\alpha + 2\\beta + 2 \\gamma$ . Thus \\[\\tan(2\\beta + 2 \\gamma) = \\frac{1}{\\tan \\alpha},\\] $\\tan(\\beta) = \\frac{r}{2}$ , $\\tan(\\gamma) = \\frac{r}{4}$ , and $\\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac {r}{3}$ . By the Tangent Addition Formula, \\[\\tan(\\beta +\\gamma) = \\frac{6r}{8-r^2}\\] and \\[\\tan(2\\beta + 2\\gamma) = \\frac{\\frac{12r}{8-r^2}}{1-\\frac{36r^2}{(8-r^2)^2}} = \\frac{12r(8-r^2)}{(8-r^2)^2-36r^2}.\\] Therefore \\[\\frac{12r(8-r^2)}{(8-r^2)^2-36r^2} = \\frac{3}{r},\\] which simplifies to $5r^4 - 84r^2 + 64 = 0$ . Then the solution proceeds as in Solution 5.\n\nSolution 7 (Official MAA 3):\nDefine $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , $d$ , $e$ , and $r$ as in Solution 5. Note that \\[\\arctan\\left(\\frac{a}{r}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{r}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{c}{r}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{d}{r}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{e}{r}\\right) = 180^{\\circ}.\\] Hence \\[\\operatorname{Arg}(r + 3i) + 2\\cdot \\operatorname{Arg}(r + 2i) + 2\\cdot  \\operatorname{Arg}(r + 4i) = 180^{\\circ}.\\] Therefore \\[\\operatorname{Im} \\big( (r + 3i)(r+2i)^2(r+4i)^2 \\big) = 0.\\] Simplifying this equation gives the same quadratic equation in $r^2$ as in Solution 5.\n\nSolution 8 (The same circle):\n2020 AIME II 13.png\n\nNotation shown on diagram. As in solution 5, we get $\\overline{AQ} \\perp  \\overline{CD}, AG = 3, GB = 2, CQ = 4$ and so on.\n\nLet $\\overline{AB}$ cross $\\overline{CD}$ at $F,  \\overline{AE}$ cross $\\overline{CD}$ at $F', CF = x.$ $FQ = FG \\implies FB = x+2.$ $\\angle BAQ = \\angle EAQ \\implies DF' = x + 2, EF' = x.$ Triangle $\\triangle AFF'$ has semiperimeter $s = 2x + 11.$\n\nThe radius of incircle $\\omega$ is $r =\\sqrt{\\frac{s-FF’}{s}}(s-AF) = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2x +11}}(x+4).$\n\nTriangle $\\triangle BCF$ has semiperimeter $s = x + 4.$\n\nThe radius of excircle $\\omega$ is $r = \\sqrt{\\frac{s(s-BF)(s-CF)}{s-BC}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{(x+4)\\cdot 2 \\cdot 4}{x - 2}}.$\n\nIt is the same radius, therefore \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2x +11}}(x+4) = \\sqrt{\\frac{8(x+4)}{x – 2}} \\implies \\frac {3(x+4)}{2x+11} = \\frac {8}{x-2} \\implies (x-8)(3x + 14) = 0 \\implies x = 8, r = 4.\\]\n\nThen the solution proceeds as in Solution 5.\n\nSolution 9 (EASIEST):\nLet $O$ be the center of the incircle and $OP$ and $OQ$ are the perpendiculars dropped from point $O$ to sides $BC$ and $CD$ respectively, making $OP = OQ = r$ . After you got $CP$ and $CQ$ by the solutions which are given above (i.e Solution 1) then\nconsider cyclic quadrilateral $OPCQ$ . Now by Pythagoras in TRIANGLE $OPC$ We get $OC^2 = r^2 + 16$ , and by Ptolemy you get $4r+4r = OC.PQ$ Making $64r^2 = (r^2 + 16)(32)$ leading to $2r^2 = (r^2 + 16)$ implying $r^2 = 16$ implying $r = 4$ . Now since in a tangential polygon Area = $sr$ where s  = semiperimeter of that polygon and r = inradius Putting those values \\implies AREA = $15r$ = $15(4)$ = $\\boxed{60}$\n\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss"}

To understand this, imagine the graph of $f(z)$ on the interval $[a, a+1)$ The graph starts at $0$ , is continuous and increasing, and approaches $a+1$ . So as long as $a+1 > 17$ , there will be a solution for $z$ in the interval.\n\nUsing this logic, we can find the number of solutions to $f(x) = y$ . For every interval $[a, a+1)$ where $a \\geq \\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor$ there will be one solution for $x$ in that interval. However, the question states $0 \\leq x \\leq 2020$ , but because $x=2020$ doesn't work we can change it to $0 \\leq x < 2020$ . Therefore, $\\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor  \\leq a \\leq 2019$ , and there are $2020 - \\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor$ solutions to $f(x) = y$ .\n\nWe can solve $f(y) = z$ similarly. $0 \\leq y < 2020$ to satisfy the bounds of $x$ , so there are $2020 - \\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor$ solutions to $f(y) = z$ , and $0 \\leq z < 2020$ to satisfy the bounds of $y$ .\n\nGoing back to $f(z) = 17$ , there is a single solution for z in the interval $[a, a+1)$ , where $17 \\leq a \\leq 2019$ . (We now have an upper bound for $a$ because we know $z < 2020$ .) There are $2003$ solutions for $z$ , and the floors of these solutions create the sequence $17, 18, 19, ..., 2018, 2019$\n\nLets first look at the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 17$ . Then $f(y) = z$ would have $2003$ solutions, and the floors of these solutions would also create the sequence $17, 18, 19, ..., 2018, 2019$ .\n\nIf we used the solution of $y$ where $\\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor = 17$ , there would be $2003$ solutions for $f(x) = y$ . If we used the solution of $y$ where $\\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor = 18$ , there would be $2002$ solutions for $x$ , and so on. So for the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 17$ , there will be $2003 + 2002 + 2001 + ... + 2 + 1 = \\binom{2004}{2}$ solutions for $x$\n\nIf we now look at the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 18$ , there would be $\\binom{2003}{2}$ solutions for $x$ . If we looked at the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 19$ , there would be $\\binom{2002}{2}$ solutions for $x$ , and so on.\n\nThe total number of solutions to $x$ is $\\binom{2004}{2} + \\binom{2003}{2} + \\binom{2002}{2} + ... + \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{2}{2}$ . Using the hockey stick theorem, we see this equals $\\binom{2005}{3}$ , and when we take the remainder of that number when divided by $1000$ , we get the answer, $\\boxed{10}$\n\n~aragornmf\n\nSolution 3 (Official MAA):\nFor any nonnegative integer $n$ , the function $f$ increases on the interval $[n,n+1)$ , with $f(n)=0$ and $f(x)<n+1$ for every $x$ in this interval. On this interval $f(x)=x(x-n)$ , which takes on every real value in the interval $[0,n+1)$ exactly once. Thus for each nonnegative real number $y$ , the equation $f(x) = y$ has exactly one solution $x \\in [n, n+1)$ for every $n \\ge \\lfloor y \\rfloor$ .\n\nFor each integer $a\\geq 17$ there is exactly one $x$ with $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=a$ such that $f(x)=17$ ; likewise for each integer $b\\geq a\\geq 17$ there is exactly one $x$ with $\\lfloor f(x)\\rfloor=a$ and $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=b$ such that $f(f(x))=17$ . Finally, for each integer $c \\ge b \\ge a \\ge 17$ there is exactly one $x$ with $\\lfloor f(f(x)) \\rfloor = a$ , $\\lfloor f(x)\\rfloor=b$ , and $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=c$ such that $f(f(f(x)))=17$ .\n\nThus $f(f(f(x)))=17$ has exactly one solution $x$ with $0\\leq x\\leq 2020$ for each triple of integers $(a,b,c)$ with $17\\leq a\\leq b\\leq c<2020$ , noting that $x=2020$ is not a solution. This nondecreasing ordered triple can be identified with a multiset of three elements of the set of $2003$ integers $\\{17,18,19,\\ldots,2019\\}$ , which can be selected in $\\binom{2005}3$ ways. Thus \\[N=\\frac{2005\\cdot 2004\\cdot 2003}{6}\\equiv 10\\hskip -.2cm \\pmod{1000}.\\]"}

We have $MT=3\\sqrt{15}$ .\n\nFanyuchen.png\n\nSince $\\angle A=\\angle CBT=\\angle BCT$ , we have $\\cos A=\\tfrac{11}{16}$ . Notice that $AXTY$ is cyclic, so $\\angle XTY=180^{\\circ}-A$ , so $\\cos XTY=-\\cos A$ , and the cosine law in $\\triangle TXY$ gives \\[1143-2XY^2=-\\frac{11}{8}\\cdot XT\\cdot YT.\\]\n\nSince $\\triangle BMT \\cong \\triangle CMT$ , we have $TM\\perp BC$ , and therefore quadrilaterals $BXTM$ and $CYTM$ are cyclic. Let $P$ (resp. $Q$ ) be the midpoint of $BT$ (resp. $CT$ ). So $P$ (resp. $Q$ ) is the center of $(BXTM)$ (resp. $CYTM$ ). Then $\\theta=\\angle ABC=\\angle MTX$ and $\\phi=\\angle ACB=\\angle YTM$ . So $\\angle XPM=2\\theta$ , so \\[\\frac{\\frac{XM}{2}}{XP}=\\sin \\theta,\\] which yields $XM=2XP\\sin \\theta=BT(=CT)\\sin \\theta=TY$ . Similarly we have $YM=XT$ .\n\nPtolemy's theorem in $BXTM$ gives \\[16TY=11TX+3\\sqrt{15}BX,\\] while Pythagoras' theorem gives $BX^2+XT^2=16^2$ . Similarly, Ptolemy's theorem in $YTMC$ gives \\[16TX=11TY+3\\sqrt{15}CY\\] while Pythagoras' theorem in $\\triangle CYT$ gives $CY^2+YT^2=16^2$ . Solve this for $XT$ and $TY$ and substitute into the equation about $\\cos XTY$ to obtain the result $XY^2=\\boxed{717}$ .\n\n(Notice that $MXTY$ is a parallelogram, which is an important theorem in Olympiad, and there are some other ways of computation under this observation.)\n\n-Fanyuchen20020715\n\nSolution 2 (Official MAA):\nLet $M$ denote the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ . The critical claim is that $M$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle AXY$ , which has the circle with diameter $\\overline{AT}$ as its circumcircle. To see this, note that because $\\angle BXT = \\angle BMT = 90^\\circ$ , the quadrilateral $MBXT$ is cyclic, it follows that \\[\\angle MXA = \\angle MXB = \\angle MTB = 90^\\circ - \\angle TBM = 90^\\circ - \\angle A,\\] implying that $\\overline{MX} \\perp \\overline{AC}$ . Similarly, $\\overline{MY} \\perp \\overline{AB}$ . In particular, $MXTY$ is a parallelogram. [asy] defaultpen(fontsize(8pt)); unitsize(0.8cm);  pair A = (0,0);  pair B = (-1.26,-4.43); pair C = (-1.26+3.89, -4.43); pair M = (B+C)/2;  pair O = circumcenter(A,B,C);  pair T = (0.68, -6.49); pair X = foot(T,A,B);  pair Y = foot(T,A,C); path omega = circumcircle(A,B,C); real rad = circumradius(A,B,C);    filldraw(A--B--C--cycle, 0.2*royalblue+white); label(\"$\\omega$\", O + rad*dir(45), SW); //filldraw(T--Y--M--X--cycle, rgb(150, 247, 254)); filldraw(T--Y--M--X--cycle, 0.2*heavygreen+white); draw(M--T);  draw(X--Y); draw(B--T--C); draw(A--X--Y--cycle); draw(omega); dot(\"$X$\", X, W);  dot(\"$Y$\", Y, E); dot(\"$O$\", O, W); dot(\"$T$\", T, S);  dot(\"$A$\", A, N);  dot(\"$B$\", B, W);  dot(\"$C$\", C, E);  dot(\"$M$\", M, N);   [/asy] Hence, by the Parallelogram Law, \\[TM^2 + XY^2 = 2(TX^2 + TY^2) = 2(1143-XY^2).\\] But $TM^2 = TB^2 - BM^2 = 16^2 - 11^2 = 135$ . Therefore \\[XY^2 = \\frac13(2 \\cdot 1143-135) = \\boxed{717}.\\]\n\nSolution 3 (Law of Cosines):\nLet $H$ be the orthocenter of $\\triangle AXY$ .\n\nLemma 1: $H$ is the midpoint of $BC$ .\n\nProof: Let $H'$ be the midpoint of $BC$ , and observe that $XBH'T$ and $TH'CY$ are cyclical. Define $H'Y \\cap BA=E$ and $H'X \\cap AC=F$ , then note that: \\[\\angle H'BT=\\angle H'CT=\\angle H'XT=\\angle H'YT=\\angle A.\\] That implies that $\\angle H'XB=\\angle H'YC=90^\\circ-\\angle A$ , $\\angle CH'Y=\\angle EH'B=90^\\circ-\\angle B$ , and $\\angle BH'Y=\\angle FH'C=90^\\circ-\\angle C$ . Thus $YH'\\perp AX$ and $XH' \\perp AY$ ; $H'$ is indeed the same as $H$ , and we have proved lemma 1.\n\nSince $AXTY$ is cyclical, $\\angle XTY=\\angle XHY$ and this implies that $XHYT$ is a paralelogram.\nBy the Law of Cosines: \\[XY^2=XT^2+TY^2+2(XT)(TY)\\cdot \\cos(\\angle A)\\] \\[XY^2=XH^2+HY^2+2(XH)(HY) \\cdot \\cos(\\angle A)\\] \\[HT^2=HX^2+XT^2-2(HX)(XT) \\cdot \\cos(\\angle A)\\] \\[HT^2=HY^2+YT^2-2(HY)(YT) \\cdot \\cos(\\angle A).\\] We add all these equations to get: \\[HT^2+XY^2=2(XT^2+TY^2) \\qquad (1).\\] We have that $BH=HC=11$ and $BT=TC=16$ using our midpoints. Note that $HT \\perp BC$ , so by the Pythagorean Theorem, it follows that $HT^2=135$ . We were also given that $XT^2+TY^2=1143-XY^2$ , which we multiply by $2$ to use equation $(1)$ . \\[2(XT^2+TY^2)=2286-2 \\cdot XY^2\\] Since $2(XT^2+TY^2)=2(HT^2+TY^2)=HT^2+XY^2$ , we have \\[135+XY^2=2286-2 \\cdot XY^2\\] \\[3 \\cdot XY^2=2151.\\] Therefore, $XY^2=\\boxed{717}$ . ~ MathLuis\n\nSolution 4 (Similarity and median):\nAIME-II-2020-15a.png\n\nUsing the Claim (below) we get $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle XTM \\sim \\triangle YMT.$\n\nCorresponding sides of similar $\\triangle XTM \\sim \\triangle YMT$ is $MT,$ so\n\n$\\triangle XTM = \\triangle YMT \\implies MY = XT, MX = TY \\implies XMYT$ – parallelogram.\n\n\\[4 TD^2 = MT^2 = \\sqrt{BT^2 - BM^2}  =\\sqrt{153}.\\] The formula for median $DT$ of triangle $XYT$ is \\[2 DT^2 = XT^2 + TY^2 – \\frac{XY^2}{2},\\] \\[3 \\cdot XY^2 = 2XT^2 + 2TY^2 + 2XY^2 –  4 DT^2,\\] \\[3 \\cdot XY^2  = 2 \\cdot 1143-153 = 2151 \\implies XY^2 = \\boxed{717}.\\]\n\nAIME-II-2020-15b.png\n\nClaim\n\nLet $\\triangle ABC$ be an acute scalene triangle with circumcircle $\\omega$ . The tangents to $\\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at $T$ . Let $X$ be the projections of $T$ onto line $AB$ . Let M be midpoint BC. Then triangle ABC is similar to triangle XTM.\n\nProof\n\n$\\angle BXT = \\angle BMT = 90^o \\implies$ the quadrilateral $MBXT$ is cyclic.\n\n$BM \\perp MT, TX \\perp AB \\implies \\angle MTX = \\angle MBA.$\n\n$\\angle CBT = \\angle BAC = \\frac {\\overset{\\Large\\frown} {BC}}{ 2} \\implies \\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle XTM.$\n\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss\n\nSolution 5 (Symmedian and Stewarts):\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$ . Note that $\\angle XYT = \\angle XAT = \\angle MAC$ because $AT$ is a symmedian. Similarly, $\\angle TXY = \\angle MAB$ . $XT = 16\\sin{C}$ and $YT = 16\\sin{C}$ . By law of sines on $XYT$ , $\\frac{16\\sin{C}}{\\sin{XYT}} = \\frac{XY}{\\sin{A}}$ . However by law of sines on $MAC$ , $\\frac{\\sin{C}}{\\sin{MAC}} = \\frac{AM}{11}$ . Combining these two yields, $\\frac{16}{11} AM = \\frac{XY}{\\sin{A}}$ . Since $\\sin{A} = \\frac{\\sqrt{135}}{16}$ , we have $XY^2 = \\frac{135}{121} AM^2$ .\n\nLetting $AB = x$ , $AC = y$ , and $AM = d$ , we have $x^2 + y^2 = 2d^2 + 242$ by Stewarts. Since $x = 2R\\sin{C}$ , and $y = 2R\\sin{B}$ by extended law of sines, we can write $\\sin^2{B} + \\sin^2{C} = \\frac{2d^2 + 242}{4R^2}$ . By law of cosines on $ABC$ , $x^2 + y^2 - 2xy(\\frac{11}{16}) = 484$ , $\\frac{11}{8} xy + 484 = 2d^2 + 242$ , $xy = \\frac{8}{11} (2d^2 - 242)$ . Then similarly as before we can write $\\sin{B}\\sin{C} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{11} (2d^2 - 242)}{4R^2}$ .\n\nBy law of cosines on $XYT$ and using $XT^2 + XY^2 + YT^2 = 1143$ , we have $512(\\sin^2{B} + \\sin^2{C}) - 1143 = -512\\sin{B}\\sin{C}(\\frac{11}{16})$ . Substituting our previous values here and using $R = \\frac{176}{\\sqrt{135}}$ yields a value for $d^2$ , and multiplying by $\\frac{135}{121}$ gives $\\boxed{717}$ .\n\n~sdfgfjh"}
