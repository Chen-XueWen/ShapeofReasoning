Let $W$ and $L$ denote a win and a loss, respectively. There are five possible outcome sequences for Zou:\n\n$LWWWW$ $WLWWW$ $WWLWW$ $WWWLW$ $WWWWL$\n\nWe proceed with casework:\n\nCase (1): Sequences #1-4, in which Zou does not lose the last race.\n\nThe probability that Zou loses a race is $\\frac13,$ and the probability that Zou wins the next race is $\\frac13.$ For each of the three other races, the probability that Zou wins is $\\frac23.$\n\nThere are four sequences in this case. The probability of one such sequence is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2\\left(\\frac23\\right)^3.$\n\nCase (2): Sequence #5, in which Zou loses the last race.\n\nThe probability that Zou loses a race is $\\frac13.$ For each of the four other races, the probability that Zou wins is $\\frac23.$\n\nThere is one sequence in this case. The probability is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^1\\left(\\frac23\\right)^4.$\n\nAnswer\n\nThe requested probability is \\[4\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2\\left(\\frac23\\right)^3+\\left(\\frac13\\right)^1\\left(\\frac23\\right)^4=\\frac{32}{243}+\\frac{16}{243}=\\frac{48}{243}=\\frac{16}{81},\\] from which the answer is $16+81=\\boxed{097}.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSolution 2 (Casework but Bashier):\nWe have $5$ cases, depending on which race Zou lost. Let $\\text{W}$ denote a won race, and $\\text{L}$ denote a lost race for Zou. The possible cases are $\\text{WWWWL, WWWLW, WWLWW, WLWWW, LWWWW}$ . The first case has probability $\\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\right)^4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{16}{3^5}$ . The second case has probability $\\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{8}{3^5}$ . The third has probability $\\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{3^5}$ . The fourth has probability $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2 = \\frac{8}{3^5}$ . Lastly, the fifth has probability $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{3^5}$ . Adding these up, the total probability is $\\frac{16 + 8 \\cdot 4}{3^5} = \\frac{16 \\cdot 3}{3^5} = \\frac{16}{81}$ , so $m+n = \\boxed{097}$ .\n\n~rocketsri\n\nThis is for if you're paranoid like me, and like to sometimes write out all of the cases if there are only a few.\n\nSolution 3 (Even More Casework):\nCase 1: Zou loses the first race\n\nIn this case, Zou must win the rest of the races. Thus, our probability is $\\frac{8}{243}$ .\n\nCase 2: Zou loses the last race\n\nThere is only one possibility for this, so our probability is $\\frac{16}{243}$ .\n\nCase 3: Neither happens\n\nThere are three ways that this happens. Each has one loss that is not the last race. Therefore, the probability that one happens is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{243}$ . Thus, the total probability is $\\frac{8}{243} \\cdot 3 = \\frac{24}{243}$ .\n\nAdding these up, we get $\\frac{48}{243} = \\frac{16}{81}$ , so $16+81=\\boxed{097}$ .\n\n~mathboy100\n\nSolution 4 (Observations):\nNote that Zou wins one race. The probability that he wins the last race is $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{16}{243}.$ Now, if he doesn't win the last race, then there must be two races where the winner of the previous race loses. We can choose any $4$ of the middle races for Zou to win. So the probability for this case is $4\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2=\\frac{32}{243}.$ Thus, the answer is $\\frac{16}{243}+\\frac{32}{243}=\\frac{16}{81}\\implies\\boxed{097}.$\n\n~pinkpig"}

Also, because we are given that $ABCD$ and $AFCE$ are rectangles, we know that $\\angle AFG= \\angle CDG=90 ^{\\circ}$ .\nTherefore, by AA similarity, we know that $\\triangle AFG\\sim\\triangle CDG$ .\n\nLet $AG=x$ . Then, we have $DG=11-x$ . By similar triangles, we know that $FG=\\frac{7}{3}(11-x)$ and $CG=\\frac{3}{7}x$ . We have $\\frac{7}{3}(11-x)+\\frac{3}{7}x=FC=9$ .\n\nSolving for $x$ , we have $x=\\frac{35}{4}$ .\nThe area of the shaded region is just $3\\cdot \\frac{35}{4}=\\frac{105}{4}$ .\n\nThus, the answer is $105+4=\\framebox{109}$ .\n\n~yuanyuanC\n\nSolution 2 (Similar Triangles):\nAgain, let the intersection of $AE$ and $BC$ be $G$ . By AA similarity, $\\triangle AFG \\sim \\triangle CDG$ with a $\\frac{7}{3}$ ratio. Define $x$ as $\\frac{[CDG]}{9}$ . Because of similar triangles, $[AFG] = 49x$ . Using $ABCD$ , the area of the parallelogram is $33-18x$ . Using $AECF$ , the area of the parallelogram is $63-98x$ . These equations are equal, so we can solve for $x$ and obtain $x = \\frac{3}{8}$ . Thus, $18x = \\frac{27}{4}$ , so the area of the parallelogram is $33 - \\frac{27}{4} = \\frac{105}{4}$ .\n\nFinally, the answer is $105+4=\\boxed{109}$ .\n\n~mathboy100\n\nSolution 3 (Pythagorean Theorem):\nLet the intersection of $AE$ and $BC$ be $G$ , and let $BG=x$ , so $CG=11-x$ .\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, ${AG}^2={AB}^2+{BG}^2$ , so $AG=\\sqrt{x^2+9}$ , and thus $EG=9-\\sqrt{x^2+9}$ .\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem again, ${CG}^2={EG}^2+{CE}^2$ : \\[11-x=\\sqrt{7^2+(9-\\sqrt{x^2+9})^2}.\\]\n\nSolving, we get $x=\\frac{9}{4}$ , so the area of the parallelogram is $3\\cdot\\left(11-\\frac{9}{4}\\right)=\\frac{105}{4}$ , and $105+4=\\framebox{109}$ .\n\n~JulianaL25\n\nSolution 4 (Pythagorean Theorem):\nLet $P = AD \\cap FC$ , and $K = AE \\cap BC$ . Also let $AP = x$ .\n\n$CK$ also has to be $x$ by parallelogram properties. Then $PD$ and $BK$ must be $11-x$ because the sum of the segments has to be $11$ .\n\nWe can easily solve for $PC$ by the Pythagorean Theorem: \\begin{align*} DC^2 + PD^2 &= PC^2\\\\ 9 + (11-x)^2 &= PC^2 \\end{align*} It follows shortly that $PC = \\sqrt{x^2-22x+30}$ .\n\nAlso, $FC = 9$ , and $FP + PC = 9$ . We can then say that $PC = \\sqrt{x^2-22x+30}$ , so $FP = 9 - \\sqrt{x^2-22x+30}$ .\n\nNow we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to $\\triangle AFP$ . \\begin{align*} AF^2 + FP^2 = AP^2\\\\ 49 + \\left(9 - \\sqrt{x^2-22x+30}\\right)^2 = x^2  \\end{align*}\n\nThis simplifies (not-as-shortly) to $x = \\dfrac{35}{4}$ . Now we have to solve for the area of $APCK$ . We know that the height is $3$ because the height of the parallelogram is the same as the height of the smaller rectangle.\n\nFrom the area of a parallelogram (we know that the base is $\\dfrac{35}{4}$ and the height is $3$ ), it is clear that the area is $\\dfrac{105}{4}$ , giving an answer of $\\boxed{109}$ .\n\n~ishanvannadil2008 (Solution Sketch)\n\n~Tuatara (Rephrasing and $\\LaTeX$ )\n\nSolution 5 (Coordinate Geometry):\nSuppose $B=(0,0).$ It follows that $A=(0,3),C=(11,0),$ and $D=(11,3).$\n\nSince $AECF$ is a rectangle, we have $AE=FC=9$ and $EC=AF=7.$ The equation of the circle with center $A$ and radius $\\overline{AE}$ is $x^2+(y-3)^2=81,$ and the equation of the circle with center $C$ and radius $\\overline{CE}$ is $(x-11)^2+y^2=49.$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two variables. Expanding and rearranging respectively give \\begin{align*} x^2+y^2-6y&=72, &(1) \\\\ x^2+y^2-22x&=-72. &(2) \\end{align*} Subtracting $(2)$ from $(1),$ we obtain $22x-6y=144.$ Simplifying and rearranging produce \\[x=\\frac{3y+72}{11}. \\hspace{34.5mm} (*)\\] Substituting $(*)$ into $(1)$ gives \\[\\left(\\frac{3y+72}{11}\\right)^2+y^2-6y=72,\\] which is a quadratic of $y.$ We clear fractions by multiplying both sides by $11^2=121,$ then solve by factoring: \\begin{align*} \\left(3y+72\\right)^2+121y^2-726y&=8712 \\\\ \\left(9y^2+432y+5184\\right)+121y^2-726y&=8712 \\\\ 130y^2-294y-3528&=0 \\\\ 2(5y+21)(13y-84)&=0 \\\\ y&=-\\frac{21}{5},\\frac{84}{13}. \\end{align*} Since $E$ is in Quadrant IV, we have $E=\\left(\\frac{3\\left(-\\frac{21}{5}\\right)+72}{11},-\\frac{21}{5}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{27}{5},-\\frac{21}{5}\\right).$ It follows that the equation of $\\overleftrightarrow{AE}$ is $y=-\\frac{4}{3}x+3.$\n\nLet $G$ be the intersection of $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{FC},$ and $H$ be the intersection of $\\overline{AE}$ and $\\overline{BC}.$ Since $H$ is the $x$ -intercept of $\\overleftrightarrow{AE},$ we get $H=\\left(\\frac94,0\\right).$\n\nBy symmetry, quadrilateral $AGCH$ is a parallelogram. Its area is $HC\\cdot AB=\\left(11-\\frac94\\right)\\cdot3=\\frac{105}{4},$ from which the requested sum is $105+4=\\boxed{109}.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSolution 6 (Trigonometry):\nLet the intersection of $AE$ and $BC$ be $G$ . It is useful to find $\\tan(\\angle DAE)$ , because $\\tan(\\angle DAE)=\\frac{3}{BG}$ and $\\frac{3}{\\tan(\\angle DAE)}=BG$ . From there, subtracting the areas of the two triangles from the larger rectangle, we get  Area = $33-3BG=33-\\frac{9}{\\tan(\\angle DAE)}$ .\n\nlet $\\angle CAD = \\alpha$ . Let $\\angle CAE = \\beta$ . Note, $\\alpha+\\beta=\\angle DAE$ .\n\n$\\alpha=\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{11}\\right)$\n\n$\\beta=\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{7}{9}\\right)$\n\n$\\tan(\\angle DAE) = \\tan\\left(\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{11}\\right)+\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{7}{9}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{11}+\\frac{7}{9}}{1-\\frac{3}{11}\\cdot\\frac{7}{9}} = \\frac{\\frac{104}{99}}{\\frac{78}{99}} = \\frac{4}{3}$\n\n$\\mathrm{Area}=33-\\frac{9}{\\frac{4}{3}} = 33-\\frac{27}{4 } = \\frac{105}{4}$ . The answer is $105+4=\\boxed{109}$ .\n\n~twotothetenthis1024"}

We first observe $a$ must be at most 10; if $a \\ge 11$ , then $2^a - 2^b \\ge 2^{10} > 1000$ . As $2^{10} = 1024 \\approx 1000$ , we can first choose two different numbers $a > b$ from the set $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$ in $\\binom{11}{2}=55$ ways. This includes $(a,b) = (10,0)$ , $(10,1)$ , $(10,2)$ , $(10,3)$ , $(10,4)$ which are invalid as $2^a - 2^b > 1000$ in this case. For all other choices $a$ and $b$ , the value of $2^a - 2^b$ is less than 1000.\n\nWe claim that for all other choices of $a$ and $b$ , the values of $2^a - 2^b$ are pairwise distinct. More specifically, if $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ where $10 \\ge a_1 > b_1 \\ge 0$ and $10 \\ge a_2 > b_2 \\ge 0$ , we must show that $2^{a_1}-2^{b_1} \\neq 2^{a_2} - 2^{b_2}$ . Suppose otherwise for sake of contradiction; rearranging yields $2^{a_1}+2^{b_2} = 2^{a_2}+2^{b_1}$ . We use the fact that every positive integer has a unique binary representation:\n\nIf $a_1 \\neq b_2$ then $\\{a_1,b_2\\} = \\{a_2,b_1\\}$ ; from here we can deduce either $a_1=a_2$ and $b_1=b_2$ (contradicting the assumption that $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ , or $a_1=b_1$ and $a_2=b_2$ (contradicting the assumption $a_1>b_1$ and $a_2>b_2$ ).\n\nIf $a_1 = b_2$ then $2^{a_1}+2^{b_2} = 2 \\times 2^{a_1}$ , and it follows that $a_1=a_2=b_1=b_2$ , also contradicting the assumption $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ . Hence we obtain contradiction.*\n\nThen there are $\\binom{11}{2}-5$ choices for $(a,b)$ for which $2^a - 2^b$ is a positive integer less than 1000; by the above claim, each choice of $(a,b)$ results in a different positive integer $n$ . Then there are $55-5 = \\boxed{050}$ integers which can be expressed as a difference of two powers of 2.\n\nNote: The uniqueness of binary representation could be rather easily proven, but if you cannot convince yourself on the spot that this is the case, consider the following alternative proof. Let $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ where $10 \\ge a_1 > b_1 \\ge 0$ and $10 \\ge a_2 > b_2 \\ge 0$ and $2^{a_1}-2^{b_1} = 2^{a_2} - 2^{b_2}$ , for the sake of contradiction. Therefore $\\deg_{2}(2^{a_1}-2^{b_1})=\\deg_{2}(2^{a_2}-2^{b_2})$ , or $b_1=b_2$ . Plugging in, we see that $2^{a_1}=2^{a_2}$ , or $a_1=a_2$ , contradiction.\n\nNote by Ross Gao\n\nSolution 2 (Casework):\nCase 1: When our answer is in the form $2^n-2^i$ , where $i$ is an integer such that $0\\le i\\le 4$ .\n\nWe start with the subcase where it is $2^n-2^0$ , for some integer $n$ where $n>0$ (this is because the case where $n=0$ yields $2^0-2^0=0$ , which doesn't work because it must be a positive integer.)\nNote that $2^{10}=1024$ , and $2^9=512$ . Our answer needs to be less than $1000$ , so the maximum possible result (in this case) is $2^9-2^0$ . Our lowest result is $2^1-2^0$ . All the positive powers of two less than $1024$ work, so we have $9$ possibilities for this subcase. For subcases $i=1, i=2, i=3,$ and $i=4$ , we have $8, 7, 6,$ and $5$ possibilities, respectively.\n\nCase 2: When our answer is in the form of $2^n-2^j$ , where $j$ is an integer such that $5\\le j\\le 9$ .\n\nWe can start with the subcase where $j=5$ . We notice that $2^5=32$ , and $2^{10}-2^5=992$ which is less than $1000$ , so the greatest result in this subcase is actually $2^{10}-2^5$ , and the lowest is $2^6-2^5$ . Thus, we have $5$ possibilities. For the other four subcases, we have $4, 3, 2,$ and $1$ possibilities, respectively.\n\nAnswer: We note that these are our only cases, as numbers in the form of $2^n-2^{10}$ and beyond are greater than $1000$ .\n\nThus, our result is $9+8+7+6+5+5+4+3+2+1=(9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1)+5=\\boxed{50}$ . ~jehu26\n\nSolution 3 (Bash):\nWe look for all positive integers of the form $2^a-2^b<1000,$ where $0\\leq b<a.$ Performing casework on $a,$ we can enumerate all possibilities in the table below: \\[\\begin{array}{c|c} & \\\\ [-2.25ex] \\boldsymbol{a} & \\boldsymbol{b} \\\\  \\hline  & \\\\ [-2ex] 1 & 0 \\\\   2 & 0,1 \\\\ 3 & 0,1,2 \\\\ 4 & 0,1,2,3 \\\\ 5 & 0,1,2,3,4 \\\\ 6 & 0,1,2,3,4,5 \\\\ 7 & 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 \\\\ 8 & 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 \\\\ 9 & 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \\\\ 10 & \\xcancel{0},\\xcancel{1},\\xcancel{2},\\xcancel{3},\\xcancel{4},5,6,7,8,9 \\\\ [0.5ex] \\end{array}\\] As indicated by the X-marks, the ordered pairs $(a,b)=(10,0),(10,1),(10,2),(10,3),(10,4)$ generate $2^a-2^b>1000,$ which are invalid.\n\nNote that each of the remaining ordered pairs generates one unique desired positive integer.\n\nWe prove this statement as follows:\n\nThe positive integers generated for each value of $a$ are clearly different. For all integers $k$ such that $1\\leq k\\leq9,$ the largest positive integer generated for $a=k$ is $1$ less than the smallest positive integer generated for $a=k+1.$\n\nTogether, we have justified our claim in bold. The answer is \\[1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+5=\\boxed{050}.\\]\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSolution 4 (Faster Way):\nBecause the difference is less than $1000$ , we can simply list out all numbers that satisfy $2^n < 1000$ . We get $0 \\le n < 10$ , where n is an integer. Because the sequence $2^n$ is geometric, the difference of any two terms will be unique. $\\binom{10}{2}$ will be the number of differences for $0\\le n < 10$ . However, we also need to consider the case in which $n=10$ . With simple counting, we find that $5$ numbers: $(32, 64, 128, 256, 512)$ could be subtracted from $1024$ , which makes another 5 cases. There is no need to check for higher exponents since the lowest difference would be $2^{11} - 2^{10} = 1024$ , which exceeds $1000$ .\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\binom{10}{2} + 5 = \\boxed{050}.$\n\n~TOMYANG"}

Then $(1, 2, 63), (1, 3, 62), \\ldots, (1, 32, 33)$ all work for a total of $31$ piles. Suppose we have $2$ coins in the first pile, then $(2, 3, 61), (2, 4, 60), \\ldots, (2, 31, 33)$ all work, for a total of $29$ . Continuing this pattern until $21$ coins in the first pile, we have the sum \\begin{align*} 31+29+28+26+25+\\cdots+4+2+1 &= (31+28+25+22+\\cdots+1)+(29+26+23+\\cdots+2) \\\\ &= 176+155 \\\\ &= \\boxed{331}. \\end{align*}\n\nSolution 2:\nWe make an equation: $a+b+c=66,$ where $a<b<c.$ We don't have a clear solution, so we'll try complementary counting. First, let's find where $a\\geq b\\geq c.$ By stars and bars, we have $\\dbinom{65}{2}=2080$ to assign positive integer solutions to $a + b + c = 66.$ Now we need to subtract off the cases where it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nWe start with $a = b.$ We can write that as $2b + c = 66.$ We can find there are 32 integer solutions to this equation. There are $32$ solutions for $b=c$ and $a = c$ by symmetry. We also need to add back $2$ because we subtracted $(a,b,c)=(22,22,22)$ $3$ times.\n\nWe then have to divide by $6$ because there are $3!=6$ ways to order $a, b,$ and $c.$ Therefore, we have $\\dfrac{\\dbinom{65}{2}-96+2}{6} = \\dfrac{1986}{6} = \\boxed{331}.$\n\n~Arcticturn\n\nSolution 3:\nLet the piles have $a, b$ and $c$ coins, with $0 < a < b < c$ . Then, let $b = a + k_1$ , and $c = b + k_2$ , such that each $k_i \\geq 1$ . The sum is then $a + a+k_1 + a+k_1+k_2 = 66 \\implies 3a+2k_1 + k_2 = 66$ . This is simply the number of positive solutions to the equation $3x+2y+z = 66$ . Now, we take cases on $a$ .\n\nIf $a = 1$ , then $2k_1 + k_2 = 63 \\implies 1 \\leq k_1 \\leq 31$ . Each value of $k_1$ corresponds to a unique value of $k_2$ , so there are $31$ solutions in this case. Similarly, if $a = 2$ , then $2k_1 + k_2 = 60 \\implies 1 \\leq k_1 \\leq 29$ , for a total of $29$ solutions in this case. If $a = 3$ , then $2k_1 + k_2 = 57 \\implies 1 \\leq k_1 \\leq 28$ , for a total of $28$ solutions. In general, the number of solutions is just all the numbers that aren't a multiple of $3$ , that are less than or equal to $31$ .\n\nWe then add our cases to get \\begin{align*} 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + \\cdots + 31 &= 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 31 - 3(1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 10) \\\\ &= \\frac{31(32)}{2} - 3(55) \\\\ &= 31 \\cdot 16 - 165 \\\\ &= 496 - 165 \\\\ &= \\boxed{331} \\end{align*} as our answer.\n\nSolution 4:\nLet the first pile have $a$ coins, the second $a+b$ coins, and the third $a+b+c$ coins, where $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are strictly positive integers. Thus the total number of coins is $3a+2b+c=66$ . Perform the substitution $x=a-1$ , $y=b-1$ , and $z=c-1$ to yield the equation $3x+2y+z=60$ , where $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ are instead nonnegative integers.\n\nFrom here we can set up the generating function $(x^0+x^3+\\cdots+x^{60})(x^0+x^2+\\cdots+x^{60})(x^0+x^1+\\cdots+x^{60})$ . We need to find the coefficient of $x^{60}$ . Multiplying the second and third polynomials with clever reasoning returns\n\n$(x^0+x^3+\\cdots+x^{60})(x^0+x^1+2x^2+2x^3+\\cdots+31x^{60}+\\cdots+2x^{117}+2x^{118}+x^{119}+x^{120})$\n\nwhere in the second polynomial, for every two terms, the coefficient increases or decreases by one (depending on which side of the polynomial the term resides).\n\nOne can notice here that for every term in the first polynomial there exists one and only one term in the second polynomial that, when multiplied, yield $x^{60}$ . Furthermore, we need only consider the coefficients of the second polynomial.\n\nThe corresponding coefficient for $x^{60}$ is $1$ , for $x^{57}$ is $2$ , and for $x^{54}$ is $4$ . We notice the pattern: increase by one, increase by two, and so on. When does this pattern stop? For $x^0$ , the corresponding coefficient is $31$ , and we notice that $31\\equiv1\\mod3$ . As a result, we know that the pattern has $21$ terms, and we can take advantage of the first $20$ by symmetry.\n\nThe answer is simply $10(1+29)+31=\\boxed{331}$ .\n\n~eevee9406\n\nSolution 4"}

Then we want $(a-b)^2+a^2+(a+b)^2=ab^2$ , or $3a^2+2b^2=ab^2$ . Rearranging, we get $b^2=\\frac{3a^2}{a-2}$ . Simplifying further, $b^2=3a+6+\\frac{12}{a-2}$ . Looking at this second equation, since the right side must be an integer, $a-2$ must equal $\\pm1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$ . Looking at the first equation, we see $a>2$ since $b^2$ is positive. This means we must test $a=3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 14$ . After testing these, we see that only $a=5$ and $a=14$ work which give $b=5$ and $b=7$ respectively. Thus the answer is $10+21=\\boxed{031}$ .\n~JHawk0224\n\nNote: You could also use synthetic division to get $b^2=\\frac{3a^2}{a-2}$ .\n\nSolution 2:\nLet the common difference be $d$ and let the middle term be $x$ . Then, we have that the sequence is \\[x-d,~x,~x+d.\\] This means that the sum of the squares of the 3 terms of the sequence is \\[(x-d)^2+x^2+(x+d)^2=x^2-2xd+d^2+x^2+x^2+2xd+d^2=3x^2+2d^2.\\] We know that this must be equal to $xd^2,$ so we can write that \\[3x^2+2d^2=xd^2,\\] and it follows that \\[3x^2-xd^2+2d^2=3x^2-\\left(d^2\\right)x+2d^2=0.\\]\n\nNow, we can treat $d$ as a constant and use the quadratic formula to get \\[x=\\frac{d^2\\pm \\sqrt{d^4-4(3)(2d^2)}}{6}.\\] We can factor pull $d^2$ out of the square root to get \\[x=\\frac{d^2\\pm d\\sqrt{d^2-24}}{6}.\\] Here, it is easy to figure out the values of $d$ . Let $\\sqrt{d^2-24} = k$ , then $d^2-k^2=24$ which is $(d+k)(d-k)=24,$ note that $d$ , $k$ are integers. Examining the parity, we find that $d+k$ and $d-k$ are of the same parity. Now, we solve by factoring. We can find that $d=5$ and $d=7$ are the only positive integer values of $d$ that make $\\sqrt{d^2-24}$ a positive integer. $^{*}$ $d=5$ gives $x=5$ and $x=\\frac{10}{3}$ , but we can ignore the latter. $d=7$ gives $x=14$ , as well as a fraction which we can ignore.\n\nSince $d=5,~x=5$ and $d=7, x=14$ are the only two solutions and we want the sum of the third terms, our answer is $(5+5)+(7+14)=10+21=\\boxed{031}$ . -BorealBear, minor edit by Kinglogic\n\n$^*$ To prove this, let $\\sqrt{d^2-24} = k$ , then $d^2-k^2=24$ which is $(d+k)(d-k)=24,$ then remembering that $d$ and $k$ are integers see if you can figure it out. - PureSwag\n\nSolution 3:\nProceed as in solution 2, until we reach \\[3x^2+2d^2=xd^2,\\] Write\n\n$d^2=\\frac{3x^2}{x-2}$ , it follows that $x-2=3k^2$ for some (positive) integer k and $k \\mid x$ .\n\nTaking both sides modulo $k$ , $-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k}$ , so $k \\mid 2 \\rightarrow k=1,2$ .\n\nWhen $k=1$ , we have $x=5$ and $d=5$ . When $k=2$ , we have $x=14$ and $d=7$ .\nSumming the two cases, we have $10+21=\\boxed{031}$ .\n\n-Ross Gao\n\nSolution 4 (Combining Solution 1 and Solution 3):\nAs in Solution 1, write the three integers in the sequence as $a-d$ , $a$ , and $a+d$ .\n\nThen the sum of the squares of the three integers is $(a-d)^2+a^2+(a+d)^2 = 3a^2+2d^2$ .\n\nSetting this equal to the middle term times the common difference squared, which is $ad^2$ ,\n\nand solving for $d^2$ we get:\n\n$3a^2+2d^2 = ad^2 \\implies ad^2-2d^2 = 3a^2 \\implies d^2(a-2) = 3a^2 \\implies d^2 = \\frac{3a^2}{a-2}$\n\nThe numerator has to be positive, so the denominator has to be positive too for the sequence\n\nto be strictly increasing; that is, $a>2$ .\n\nFor $\\frac{3a^2}{a-2}$ to be a perfect square, $\\frac{3}{a-2}$ must be a perfect square as well.\n\nThis means that $a-2$ is divisible by 3, and whatever left over is a perfect square.\n\nWe can express this as an equation: let the perfect square left over be $n^2$ . Then:\n\n$3n^2 = a-2$ . Now when you divide the numerator and denominator by 3, you are left with\n\n$d^2 = \\frac{a^2}{n^2} \\implies d = \\frac{a}{n}$ . Because the sequence is of integers, d must also be an\n\ninteger, which means that $n$ must divide $a$ .\n\nTaking the above equation we can solve for $a$ : $3n^2 = a-2 \\implies a = 3n^2+2$ .\n\nThis means that $3n^2+2$ is divisible by $n$ . $3n^2$ is automatically divisible by $n$ , so\n\n$2$ must be divisible by $n$ . Then $n$ must be either of $\\{1,2\\}$ . Plugging back into the\nequation,\n\n$n = 1 \\implies a = 5 \\implies d = 5$ , so $a+d = 5+5 = 10$ .\n\n$n = 2 \\implies a = 14 \\implies d = 7$ , so $a+d = 14+7 = 21$ .\n\nFinally, $10+21 = \\boxed{031}$\n\n-KingRavi\n\nSolution 5:\nFollowing from previous solutions, we derive $3x^2+2a^2=xa^2.$ We divide both sides to get $3\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)^2+2=x.$ Since $x$ is an integer, $\\frac{x}{a}$ must also be an integer, so we have $x=pa$ , for some factor $p$ . We then get $3p^2+2=pa.$ We then take this to modulo $p$ , getting $2\\equiv 0 \\pmod p.$ The only possibilities for $p$ are therefore 1 and 2. We plug these into $3p^2+2=pa$ , for $a=5$ and $x=5$ , giving us the sequence $0,5,10$ , or $2a=14$ and $x=14$ , for the sequence $7,14,21.$ $10+21 = \\boxed{031}.$\n\n-RYang2"}

Let point $P$ have coordinates $(x, y, z)$ , point $A$ have coordinates $(0, 0, 0)$ , and $s$ be the side length. Then we have the equations \\begin{align*} (s-x)^2+y^2+z^2&=\\left(5\\sqrt{10}\\right)^2, \\\\ x^2+(s-y)^2+z^2&=\\left(5\\sqrt{5}\\right)^2, \\\\ x^2+y^2+(s-z)^2&=\\left(10\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2, \\\\ (s-x)^2+(s-y)^2+(s-z)^2&=\\left(3\\sqrt{7}\\right)^2. \\end{align*} These simplify into \\begin{align*} s^2+x^2+y^2+z^2-2sx&=250, \\\\ s^2+x^2+y^2+z^2-2sy&=125, \\\\ s^2+x^2+y^2+z^2-2sz&=200, \\\\ 3s^2-2s(x+y+z)+x^2+y^2+z^2&=63. \\end{align*} Adding the first three equations together, we get $3s^2-2s(x+y+z)+3(x^2+y^2+z^2)=575$ .\nSubtracting this from the fourth equation, we get $2(x^2+y^2+z^2)=512$ , so $x^2+y^2+z^2=256$ . This means $PA=16$ . However, we scaled down everything by $12$ so our answer is $16*12=\\boxed{192}$ .\n\n~JHawk0224\n\nSolution 2 (Solution 1 with Slight Simplification):\nOnce the equations for the distance between point P and the vertices of the cube have been written, we can add the first, second, and third to receive, \\[2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + (s-x)^2 + (s-y)^2 + (s-z)^2 = 250 + 125 + 200.\\] Subtracting the fourth equation gives \\begin{align*} 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) &= 575 - 63 \\\\ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 &= 256 \\\\ \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} &= 16. \\end{align*} Since point $A = (0,0,0), PA = 16$ , and since we scaled the answer is $16 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{192}$ .\n\n~Aaryabhatta1\n\nSolution 3:\nLet $E$ be the vertex of the cube such that $ABED$ is a square.\nUsing the British Flag Theorem , we can easily show that \\[PA^2 + PE^2 = PB^2 + PD^2\\] and \\[PA^2 + PG^2 = PC^2 + PE^2\\] Hence, by adding the two equations together, we get $2PA^2 + PG^2 = PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2$ . Substituting in the values we know, we get $2PA^2 + 7\\cdot 36^2 =10\\cdot60^2 + 5\\cdot 60^2 + 2\\cdot 120^2$ .\n\nThus, we can solve for $PA$ , which ends up being $\\boxed{192}$ .\n\n(Lokman GÖKÇE) size:100px\n\nSolution 4:\nFor all points $X$ in space, define the function $f:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ by $f(X)=PX^{2}-GX^{2}$ . Then $f$ is linear; let $O=\\frac{2A+G}{3}$ be the center of $\\triangle BCD$ . Then since $f$ is linear, \\begin{align*} 3f(O)=f(B)+f(C)+f(D)&=2f(A)+f(G) \\\\  \\left(PB^{2}-GB^{2}\\right)+\\left(PC^{2}-GC^{2}\\right)+\\left(PD^{2}-GD^{2}\\right)&=2\\left(PA^{2}-GA^{2}\\right)+PG^{2} \\\\ \\left(60\\sqrt{10}\\right)^{2}-2x^{2}+\\left(60\\sqrt{5}\\right)^{2}-2x^{2}+\\left(120\\sqrt{2}\\right)^{2}-2x^{2}&=2PA^{2}-2\\cdot 3x^{2}+\\left(36\\sqrt{7}\\right)^{2}, \\end{align*} where $x$ denotes the side length of the cube. Thus \\begin{align*}  36\\text{,}000+18\\text{,}000+28\\text{,}800-6x^{2}&=2PA^{2}-6x^{2}+9072 \\\\  82\\text{,}800-6x^{2}&=2PA^{2}-6x^{2}+9072 \\\\  73\\text{,}728&=2PA^{2} \\\\  36\\text{,}864&=PA^{2} \\\\  PA&=\\boxed{192}. \\end{align*}"}

This corresponds to choosing two elements from the set $\\{1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29\\}$ . There are $\\binom 82$ ways to do so.\n\nIf $k < 1$ , by multiplying $m$ and $n$ by the same constant $c = \\frac{1}{k}$ , we have that $mc \\equiv nc \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ . Then either $m \\equiv n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ , or $m \\equiv n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ . But the first case was already counted, so we don't need to consider that case. The other case corresponds to choosing two numbers from the set $\\{3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27\\}$ . There are $\\binom 72$ ways here. (This argument seems to have a logical flaw *check note at bottom*)\n\nFinally, if $k > 1$ , note that $k$ must be an integer. This means that $m, n$ belong to the set $\\{k, 5k, 9k, \\dots\\}$ , or $\\{3k, 7k, 11k, \\dots\\}$ . Taking casework on $k$ , we get the sets $\\{2, 10, 18, 26\\}, \\{6, 14, 22, 30\\}, \\{4, 20\\}, \\{12, 28\\}$ . Some sets have been omitted; this is because they were counted in the other cases already. This sums to $\\binom 42 + \\binom 42 + \\binom 22 + \\binom 22$ .\n\nIn total, there are $\\binom 82 + \\binom 72 + \\binom 42 + \\binom 42 + \\binom 22 + \\binom 22 = \\boxed{063}$ pairs of $(m, n)$ .\n\nThis solution was brought to you by ~Leonard_my_dude~\n\nSolution 2:\nIn order for $\\sin(mx) + \\sin(nx) = 2$ , $\\sin(mx) = \\sin(nx) = 1$ .\n\nThis happens when $mx \\equiv nx \\equiv \\frac{\\pi}{2} ($ mod $2\\pi).$\n\nThis means that $mx = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi\\alpha$ and $nx = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2\\pi\\beta$ for any integers $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ .\n\nAs in Solution 1, take the ratio of the two equations: \\[\\frac{mx}{nx} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2\\pi\\alpha}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2\\pi\\beta} \\implies \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}+2\\alpha}{\\frac{1}{2}+2\\beta} \\implies \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{4\\alpha+1}{4\\beta+1}\\]\n\nNow notice that the numerator and denominator of $\\frac{4\\alpha+1}{4\\beta+1}$ are both odd, which means that $m$ and $n$ have the same power of two (the powers of 2 cancel out).\n\nLet the common power be $p$ : then $m = 2^p\\cdot a$ , and $n = 2^p\\cdot b$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers between 1 and 30.\n\nWe can now rewrite the equation: \\[\\frac{2^p\\cdot a}{2^p\\cdot b} = \\frac{4\\alpha+1}{4\\beta+1} \\implies \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{4\\alpha+1}{4\\beta+1}\\]\n\nNow it is easy to tell that $a \\equiv 1 ($ mod $4)$ and $b \\equiv 1 ($ mod $4)$ . However, there is another case: that\n\n$a \\equiv 3 ($ mod $4)$ and $b \\equiv 3 ($ mod $4)$ . This is because multiplying both $4\\alpha+1$ and $4\\beta+1$ by $-1$ will not change the fraction, but each congruence will be changed to $-1 ($ mod $4) \\equiv 3 ($ mod $4)$ .\n\nFrom the first set of congruences, we find that $a$ and $b$ can be two of $\\{1, 5, 9, \\ldots, 29\\}$ .\n\nFrom the second set of congruences, we find that $a$ and $b$ can be two of $\\{3, 7, 11, \\ldots, 27\\}$ .\n\nNow all we have to do is multiply by $2^p$ to get back to $m$ and $n$ .\nLet’s organize the solutions in order of increasing values of $p$ , keeping in mind that $m$ and $n$ are bounded between 1 and 30.\n\nFor $p = 0$ we get $\\{1, 5, 9, \\ldots, 29\\}, \\{3, 7, 11, \\ldots, 27\\}$ .\n\nFor $p = 1$ we get $\\{2, 10, 18, 26\\}, \\{6, 14, 22, 30\\}$\n\nFor $p = 2$ we get $\\{4, 20\\}, \\{12, 28\\}$\n\nNote that $16\\mid{a}$ since $m$ will cancel out a factor of 4 from $a$ , and $\\frac{a}{m}$ must contain a factor of 4. Again, $1-4X$ will never contribute a factor of 2. Simply inspecting, we see two feasible values for $a$ and $m$ such that $a+m\\leq30$ .\n\nIf we increase the value of $p$ more, there will be less than two integers in our sets, so we are done there.\n\nThere are 8 numbers in the first set, 7 in the second, 4 in the third, 4 in the fourth, 2 in the fifth, and 2 in the sixth.\n\nIn each of these sets we can choose 2 numbers to be $m$ and $n$ and then assign them in increasing order. Thus there are:\n\n\\[\\dbinom{8}{2}+\\dbinom{7}{2}+\\dbinom{4}{2}+\\dbinom{4}{2}+\\dbinom{2}{2}+\\dbinom{2}{2} = 28+21+6+6+1+1 = \\boxed{063}\\] possible pairs $(m,n)$ that satisfy the conditions.\n\n-KingRavi\n\nSolution 3:\nWe know that the range of sine is between $-1$ and $1$ , inclusive.\n\nThus, the only way for the sum to be $2$ is for $\\sin(mx)=\\sin(nx)=1$ .\n\nNote that $\\sin(90+360k)=1$ .\n\nAssuming $mx$ and $nx$ are both positive, $m$ and $n$ could be $1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29$ . There are $8$ ways, so $\\dbinom{8}{2}$ .\n\nIf both are negative, $m$ and $n$ could be $3,7,11,15,19,23,27$ . There are $7$ ways, so $\\dbinom{7}{2}$ .\n\nHowever, the pair $(1,5)$ could also be $(2, 10)$ and so on. The same goes for some other pairs.\n\nIn total there are $14$ of these extra pairs.\n\nThe answer is $28+21+14 = \\boxed{063}$ .\n\nSolution 4:\nThe equation implies that $\\sin(mx)=\\sin(nx)=1$ . Therefore, we can write $mx$ as $2{\\pi}k_1+\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $nx$ as $2{\\pi}k_2+\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for integers $k_1$ and $k_2$ . Then, $\\frac{mx}{nx}=\\frac{m}{n}=\\frac{2k_1+\\frac{1}{2}}{2k_2+\\frac{1}{2}}$ . Cross multiplying, we get $m\\cdot{(2k_2+\\frac{1}{2})}=n\\cdot{(2k_1+\\frac{1}{2})} \\Longrightarrow 4k_2m-4k_1n=n-m$ . Let $n-m=a$ so the equation becomes $4(m(k_2-k_1)+k_1a)=a$ . Let $k_2-k_1=X$ and $k_1=Y$ , then the equation becomes $a=4Ym+4Xa \\Longrightarrow \\frac{a(1-4X)}{m}=4Y$ . Note that $X$ and $Y$ can vary accordingly, and $4\\mid{a}$ . Next, we do casework on $m\\pmod{4}$ :\n\nIf $m\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}$ :\n\nOnce $a$ and $m$ are determined, $n$ is determined, so $a+m\\leq30$ . $a\\in \\{4,8,12,\\dots,28\\}$ and $m\\in \\{1,5,9,\\dots,29\\}$ . Therefore, there are $\\sum_{i=1}^{7}{i}=28$ ways for this case such that $a+m\\leq30$ .\n\nIf $m\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$ :\n\n$a\\in \\{4,8,12,\\dots,28\\}$ and $m\\in \\{3,7,11,\\dots,27\\}$ . Therefore, there are $\\sum_{i=1}^{6}{i}=21$ ways such that $a+m\\leq30$ .\n\nIf $m\\equiv 2\\pmod{4}$ :\n\nNote that $8\\mid{a}$ since $m$ in this case will have a factor of 2, which will cancel out a factor of 2 in $a$ , and we need the left hand side to divide 4. Also, $1-4X\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}$ so it is odd and will therefore never contribute a factor of 2. $a\\in \\{8,16,24\\}$ and $m\\in \\{2,6,10,\\dots,30\\}$ . Following the condition $a+m\\leq30$ , we conclude that there are $6+4+2=12$ ways for this case.\n\nIf $m\\equiv 0\\pmod{4}$ :\n\nAdding all the cases up, we obtain $28+21+12+2=\\boxed{063}$\n\n~ Magnetoninja"}

The fact that $f(x)$ is an even function ( $f(x)=f(-x)$ holds for all real numbers $x,$ so the graph of $y=f(x)$ is symmetric about the $y$ -axis) should facilitate the process of graphing.

We shift the graphs of $y=\\pm21$ up $c$ units, where $c\\geq0:$\n\nFor $f(x)=c+21$ to have $6$ distinct real solutions, we need $0\\leq c<79.$\n\nFor $f(x)=c-21$ to have $6$ distinct real solutions, we need $21<c<121.$\n\nTaking the intersection of these two cases gives $21<c<79,$ from which there are $79-21-1=\\boxed{057}$ such integers $c.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSolution 2 (Graphing):\nGraph $y=|20|x|-x^2|$ (If you are having trouble, look at the description in the next two lines and/or the diagram in Solution 1). Notice that we want this to be equal to $c-21$ and $c+21$ .\n\nWe see that from left to right, the graph first dips from very positive to $0$ at $x=-20$ , then rebounds up to $100$ at $x=-10$ , then falls back down to $0$ at $x=0$ .\n\nThe positive $x$ are symmetric, so the graph re-ascends to $100$ at $x=10$ , falls back to $0$ at $x=10$ , and rises to arbitrarily large values afterwards.\n\nNow we analyze the $y$ (varied by $c$ ) values. At $y=k<0$ , we will have no solutions, as the line $y=k$ will have no intersections with our graph.\n\nAt $y=0$ , we will have exactly $3$ solutions for the three zeroes.\n\nAt $y=n$ for any $n$ strictly between $0$ and $100$ , we will have exactly $6$ solutions.\n\nAt $y=100$ , we will have $4$ solutions, because local maxima are reached at $x= \\pm 10$ .\n\nAt $y=m>100$ , we will have exactly $2$ solutions.\n\nTo get $12$ distinct solutions for $y=|20|x|-x^2|=c \\pm 21$ , both $c +21$ and $c-21$ must produce $6$ solutions.\n\nThus $0<c-21$ and $c+21<100$ , so $c \\in \\{ 22, 23, \\dots , 77, 78 \\}$ is required.\n\nIt is easy to verify that all of these choices of $c$ produce $12$ distinct solutions (none overlap), so our answer is $\\boxed{057}$ .\n\nSolution 3 (Graphing):\nLet $y = |x|.$ Then the equation becomes $\\left|\\left|20y-y^2\\right|-c\\right| = 21$ , or $\\left|y^2-20y\\right| = c \\pm 21$ . Note that since $y = |x|$ , $y$ is nonnegative, so we only care about nonnegative solutions in $y$ . Notice that each positive solution in $y$ gives two solutions in $x$ ( $x = \\pm y$ ), whereas if $y = 0$ is a solution, this only gives one solution in $x$ , $x = 0$ . Since the total number of solutions in $x$ is even, $y = 0$ must not be a solution. Hence, we require that $\\left|y^2-20y\\right| = c \\pm 21$ has exactly $6$ positive solutions and is not solved by $y = 0.$\n\nIf $c < 21$ , then $c - 21$ is negative, and therefore cannot be the absolute value of $y^2 - 20y$ . This means the equation's only solutions are in $\\left|y^2-20y\\right| = c + 21$ . There is no way for this equation to have $6$ solutions, since the quadratic $y^2-20y$ can only take on each of the two values $\\pm(c + 21)$ at most twice, yielding at most $4$ solutions. Hence, $c \\ge 21$ . $c$ also can't equal $21$ , since this would mean $y = 0$ would solve the equation. Hence, $c > 21.$\n\nAt this point, the equation $y^2-20y = c \\pm 21$ will always have exactly $2$ positive solutions, since $y^2-20y$ takes on each positive value exactly once when $y$ is restricted to positive values (graph it to see this), and $c \\pm 21$ are both positive. Therefore, we just need $y^2-20y = -(c \\pm 21)$ to have the remaining $4$ solutions exactly. This means the horizontal lines at $-(c \\pm 21)$ each intersect the parabola $y^2 - 20y$ in two places. This occurs when the two lines are above the parabola's vertex $(10,-100)$ . Hence we have \\begin{align*} -(c + 21) &> -100 \\\\ c + 21 &< 100 \\\\ c &< 79. \\end{align*} Hence, the integers $c$ satisfying the conditions are those satisfying $21 < c < 79.$ There are $\\boxed{057}$ such integers.\n\nNote: Be careful of counting at the end, you may mess up and get $59$ .\n\nSolution 4 (Algebra):\nRemoving the absolute value bars from the equation successively, we get \\begin{align*} \\left|\\left|20|x|-x^2\\right|-c\\right|&=21 \\\\ \\left|20|x|-x^2\\right|&= c \\pm21 \\\\ 20|x|-x^2 &= \\pm c \\pm 21 \\\\ x^2 \\pm 20x \\pm c \\pm21 &= 0. \\end{align*} The discriminant of this equation is \\[\\sqrt{400-4(\\pm c \\pm 21)}.\\] Equating the discriminant to $0$ , we see that there will be two distinct solutions to each of the possible quadratics above only in the interval $-79 < c < 79$ . However, the number of zeros the equation $ax^2+b|x|+k$ has is determined by where $ax^2+bx+k$ and $ax^2-bx+k$ intersect, namely at $(0,k)$ . When $k>0$ , $a>0$ , $ax^2+b|x|+k$ will have only $2$ solutions, and when $k<0$ , $a>0$ , then there will be $4$ real solutions, if they exist at all.\nIn order to have $12$ solutions here, we thus need to ensure $-c+21<0$ , so that exactly $2$ out of the $4$ possible equations of the form $ax^2+b|x|+k$ given above have y-intercepts below $0$ and only $2$ real solutions, while the remaining $2$ equations have $4$ solutions. This occurs when $c>21$ , so our final bounds are $21<c<79$ , giving us $\\boxed{057}$ valid values of $c$ ."}

It follows that $\\frac{BG}{AG}=\\frac{AG}{HG},$ so $BG\\cdot HG=AG^2,$ or \\[\\sqrt{x^2-10^2}\\cdot\\sqrt{y^2-10^2}=10^2. \\hspace{10mm} (1)\\] Since $\\angle AHB = \\angle FHD$ by vertical angles, we have $\\triangle AHB \\sim \\triangle FHD$ by AA, with the ratio of similitude $\\frac{AH}{FH}=\\frac{BA}{DF}.$ It follows that $DF=BA\\cdot\\frac{FH}{AH}=x\\cdot\\frac{18-y}{y}.$\n\nSince $\\angle EBA = \\angle ECD = \\angle FDA$ by angle chasing, we have $\\triangle EBA \\sim \\triangle FDA$ by AA, with the ratio of similitude $\\frac{EA}{FA}=\\frac{BA}{DA}.$ It follows that $DA=BA\\cdot\\frac{FA}{EA}=x\\cdot\\frac{18}{15}=\\frac{6}{5}x.$\n\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem on right $\\triangle ADF,$ we have $DF^2+AF^2=AD^2,$ or \\[\\left(x\\cdot\\frac{18-y}{y}\\right)^2+18^2=\\left(\\frac{6}{5}x\\right)^2. \\hspace{7mm} (2)\\] Solving this system of equations ( $(1)$ and $(2)$ ), we get $x=\\frac{45\\sqrt2}{4}$ and $y=\\frac{90}{7},$ so $AB=x=\\frac{45\\sqrt2}{4}$ and $CD=AB+2DF=x+2\\left(x\\cdot\\frac{18-y}{y}\\right)=\\frac{81\\sqrt2}{4}.$ Finally, the area of $ABCD$ is \\[K=\\frac{AB+CD}{2}\\cdot AF=\\frac{567\\sqrt2}{2},\\] from which $\\sqrt2 \\cdot K=\\boxed{567}.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nRemark\n\nInstead of solving the system of equations $(1)$ and $(2),$ which can be time consuming, by noting that $\\triangle ACF \\sim \\triangle ABG$ by AA, we could find out $\\frac{AB}{AG} = \\frac{AC}{AF}$ , which gives $AC = \\frac{9}{5}x$ . We also know that $EB = \\sqrt{x^2 - 15^2}$ by Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle ABE$ . From $BC = AD = \\frac{6}{5}x,$ we apply the Pythagorean Theorem to $\\triangle ACE$ and obtain \\[AC^2 = (EB+BC)^2 + AE^2.\\] Substituting, we get \\[\\frac{81}{25}x^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{x^2 -225}+\\frac{6}{5}x\\right)^2+225 \\iff x = 3\\sqrt{x^2 - 15^2},\\] from which $x = \\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4}.$\n\n~Chupdogs\n\nSolution 2 (Similar Triangles and Pythagorean Theorem):\nFirst, draw the diagram. Then, notice that since $ABCD$ is isosceles, $\\Delta ABD \\cong \\Delta BAC$ , and the length of the altitude from $B$ to $AC$ is also $10$ . Let the foot of this altitude be $F$ , and let the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$ be denoted as $E$ . Then, $\\Delta BCF \\sim \\Delta ACE$ . So, $\\frac{BC}{AC} = \\frac{BF}{AE} = \\frac{2}{3}$ . Now, notice that $[ABC] = \\frac{10 \\cdot AC} {2} = \\frac{AB \\cdot 18}{2} \\implies AC = \\frac{9 \\cdot AB}{5}$ , where $[ABC]$ denotes the area of triangle $ABC$ . Letting $AB = x$ , this equality becomes $AC = \\frac{9x}{5}$ . Also, from $\\frac{BC}{AC} = \\frac{2}{3}$ , we have $BC = \\frac{6x}{5}$ . Now, by the Pythagorean theorem on triangles $ABF$ and $CBF$ , we have $AF = \\sqrt{x^{2}-100}$ and $CF = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{6x}{5} \\right) ^{2}-100}$ . Notice that $AC = AF + CF$ , so $\\frac{9x}{5} = \\sqrt{x^{2}-100} + \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{6x}{5} \\right) ^{2}-100}$ . Squaring both sides of the equation once, moving $x^{2}-100$ and $\\left( \\frac{6x}{5} \\right) ^{2}-100$ to the right, dividing both sides by $2$ , and squaring the equation once more, we are left with $\\frac{32x^{4}}{25} = 324x^{2}$ . Dividing both sides by $x^{2}$ (since we know $x$ is positive), we are left with $\\frac{32x^{2}}{25} = 324$ . Solving for $x$ gives us $x = \\frac{45}{2\\sqrt{2}}$ .\n\nNow, let the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $CD$ be $G$ . Then let $DG = y$ . Let the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $CD$ be $H$ . Then, $CH$ is also equal to $y$ . Notice that $ABHG$ is a rectangle, so $GH = x$ . Now, we have $CG = GH + CH = x + y$ . By the Pythagorean theorem applied to $\\Delta AGC$ , we have $(x+y)^{2}+18^{2}= \\left( \\frac{9x}{5} \\right) ^{2}$ . We know that $\\frac{9x}{5} = \\frac{9}{5} \\cdot \\frac{45}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{81}{2\\sqrt{2}}$ , so we can plug this into this equation. Solving for $x+y$ , we get $x+y=\\frac{63}{2\\sqrt{2}}$ .\n\nFinally, to find $[ABCD]$ , we use the formula for the area of a trapezoid: $K = [ABCD] = \\frac{b_{1}+b_{2}}{2} \\cdot h = \\frac{AB+CD}{2} \\cdot 18 = \\frac{x+(CG+DG)}{2} \\cdot 18 = \\frac{2x+2y}{2} \\cdot 18 = (x+y) \\cdot 18 = \\frac{63}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot 18 = \\frac{567}{\\sqrt{2}}$ . The problem asks us for $K \\cdot \\sqrt{2}$ , which comes out to be $\\boxed{567}$ .\n\n~advanture\n\nSolution 3 (Similar Triangles and Pythagorean Theorem):\nMake $AE$ perpendicular to $BC$ ; $AG$ perpendicular to $BD$ ; $AF$ perpendicular $DC$ .\n\nIt's obvious that $\\triangle{AEB} \\sim \\triangle{AFD}$ . Let $EB=5x; AB=5y; DF=6x; AD=6y$ . Then make $BQ$ perpendicular to $DC$ , it's easy to get $BQ=18$ .\n\nSince $AB$ parallel to $DC$ , $\\angle{ABG}=\\angle{BDQ}$ , so $\\triangle{ABG} \\sim \\triangle{BDQ}$ . After drawing the altitude, it's obvious that $FQ=AB=5y$ , so $DQ=5y+6x$ . According to the property of similar triangles, $AG/BQ=BG/DQ$ . So, $\\frac{5}{9}=\\frac{GB}{(6x+5y)}$ , or $GB=\\frac{(30x+25y)}{9}$ .\n\nNow, we see the $\\triangle AEB$ , pretty easy to find that $15^2+(5x)^2=(5y)^2$ , then we get $x^2+9=y^2$ , then express $y$ into $x$ form that $y=\\sqrt{x^2+9}$ we put the length of $BG$ back to $\\triangle AGB$ : $BG^2+100=AB^2$ . So, \\[\\frac{[30x+25\\sqrt{(x^2+9)}]^2}{81}+100=(5\\sqrt{x^2+9})^2.\\] After calculating, we can have a final equation of $x^2+9=\\sqrt{x^2+9}\\cdot3x$ . It's easy to find $x=\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ then $y=\\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ . So, \\[\\sqrt{2}\\cdot K = \\sqrt{2}\\cdot(5y+5y+6x+6x)\\cdot9=\\boxed{567}.\\] ~bluesoul\n\nSolution 4 (Cyclic Quadrilaterals, Similar Triangles, Pythagorean Theorem):\nLet the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$ be $P$ , to $CD$ be $Q$ , and to $BD$ be $R$ .\n\nNote that all isosceles trapezoids are cyclic quadrilaterals; thus, $A$ is on the circumcircle of $\\triangle BCD$ and we have that $PRQ$ is the Simson Line from $A$ . As $\\angle QAB = 90^\\circ$ , we have that $\\angle QAR = 90^\\circ - \\angle RAB =\\angle ABR = \\angle APR = \\angle APQ$ , with the last equality coming from cyclic quadrilateral $APBR$ . Thus, $\\triangle QAR \\sim \\triangle QPA$ and we have that $\\frac{AQ}{AR} = \\frac{PQ}{PA}$ or that $\\frac{18}{10} = \\frac{QP}{15}$ , which we can see gives us that $QP = 27$ . Further ratios using the same similar triangles gives that $QR = 12$ and $RP = 15$ .\n\nWe also see that quadrilaterals $APBR$ and $ARQD$ are both cyclic,it is clear that $\\angle AQR =\\angle ADR$ and $\\angle APR =\\angle ABR$ ,which shows $\\triangle ABD \\sim \\triangle APQ$ . we wish to find the ratio of similitude between the two triangles.\n\nTo do this, we use the one number we have for $\\triangle ABD$ : we know that the altitude from $A$ to $BD$ has length $10$ . As the two triangles are similar, if we can find the height from $A$ to $PQ$ , we can take the ratio of the two heights as the ratio of similitude. To do this, we once again note that $QP = 27$ . Using this, we can drop the altitude from $A$ to $QP$ and let it intersect $QP$ at $H$ . Then, let $QH = x$ and thus $HP=27-x$ . We then have by the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle AQH$ and $\\triangle APH$ : \\begin{align*} 18^2 - x^2 &= 15^2 - (27-x)^2 \\\\ 324 - x^2 &= 225 - (x^2-54x+729) \\\\ 54x &= 828 \\\\ x &= \\frac{46}{3}. \\end{align*} Then, $RH = QH - QR = \\frac{46}{3} - 12 = \\frac{10}{3}$ . This gives us then from right triangle $\\triangle ARH$ that $AH = \\frac{20\\sqrt{2}}{3}$ and thus the ratio of $\\triangle APQ$ to $\\triangle ABD$ is $\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ . From this, we see then that \\[AB = AP \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} = 15 \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\] and \\[AD = AQ \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} = 18 \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{27\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\\] The Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle AQD$ then gives that \\[QD = \\sqrt{AD^2 - AQ^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{27\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2 - 18^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{81}{2}} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\\] Then, we have the height of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $AQ = 18$ , the top base is $AB = \\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ , and the bottom base is $CD = \\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4} + 2\\cdot\\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . From the equation of a trapezoid, $K = \\frac{b_1+b_2}{2} \\cdot h = \\frac{63\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\cdot 18 = \\frac{567\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ , so the answer is $K\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{567}$ .\n\n~lvmath\n\n~Corrected by dongjiu0728(Former Ans made the wrong QH and wrong QR、RP but somehow came to the right answer,which trapped me for a weekend)\n\nSolution 5 (Cyclic Quadrilaterals, Similar Triangles, Pythagorean Theorem):\nLet $E,F,$ and $G$ be the feet of the altitudes from $A$ to $BC,CD,$ and $DB$ , respectively.\n\nClaim: We have $2$ pairs of similar right triangles: $\\triangle AEB \\sim \\triangle AFD$ and $\\triangle AGD \\sim \\triangle AEC$ .\n\nProof: Note that $ABCD$ is cyclic. We need one more angle, and we get this from this cyclic quadrilateral: \\begin{align*} \\angle ABE &= 180^\\circ - \\angle ABC =\\angle ADC = \\angle ADG, \\\\ \\angle ADG &= \\angle ADB =\\angle ACB = \\angle ACE. \\hspace{20mm} \\square \\end{align*} Let $AD=a$ . We obtain from the similarities $AB = \\frac{5a}{6}$ and $AC=BD=\\frac{3a}{2}$ .\n\nBy Ptolemy, $\\left(\\frac{3a}{2}\\right)^2 = a^2 + \\frac{5a}{6} \\cdot CD$ , so $\\frac{5a^2}{4} = \\frac{5a}{6} \\cdot CD$ .\n\nWe obtain $CD=\\frac{3a}{2}$ , so $DF=\\frac{CD-AB}{2}=\\frac{a}{3}$ .\n\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem on $\\triangle ADF$ , we get $324=a^2 - \\frac{a^2}{9}=\\frac{8a^2}{9}$ .\n\nThus, $a=\\frac{27}{\\sqrt{2}}$ , and $[ABCD]=\\frac{AB+CD}{2} \\cdot 18 = \\frac{\\frac{5a}{6} +\\frac{9a}{6}}{2} \\cdot 18 = 18 \\cdot \\frac{7}{6} \\cdot \\frac{27}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{567}{\\sqrt{2}}$ , yielding $\\sqrt2\\cdot[ABCD]=\\boxed{567}$ .\n\nSolution 6 (Similar Triangles and Trigonometry):\nLet $AD=BC=a$ . Draw diagonal $AC$ and let $G$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$ , $F$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to line $BC$ , and $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $DC$ .\n\nNote that $\\triangle CBG\\sim\\triangle CAF$ , and we get that $\\frac{10}{15}=\\frac{a}{AC}$ . Therefore, $AC=\\frac32 a$ . It then follows that $\\triangle ABF\\sim\\triangle ADH$ . Using similar triangles, we can then find that $AB=\\frac{5}{6}a$ . Using the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle ABC$ , We can find that the $\\cos\\angle ABC=-\\frac{1}{3}$ . Since $\\angle ABF=\\angle ADH$ , and each is supplementary to $\\angle ABC$ , we know that the $\\cos\\angle ADH=\\frac{1}{3}$ . It then follows that $a=\\frac{27\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . Then it can be found that the area $K$ is $\\frac{567\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . Multiplying this by $\\sqrt{2}$ , the answer is $\\boxed{567}$ .\n\n~happykeeper\n\nSolution 7 (Similar Triangles and Trigonometry):\nDraw the distances in terms of $B$ , as shown in the diagram. By similar triangles, $\\triangle{AEC}\\sim\\triangle{BIC}$ . As a result, let $AB=u$ , then $BC=AD=\\frac{6}{5}u$ and $2AC=3BC$ . The triangle $ABC$ is $6-5-9$ which $\\cos(\\angle{ABC})=-\\frac{1}{3}$ . By angle subtraction, $\\cos(180-\\theta)=-\\cos\\theta$ . Therefore, $AB=\\frac{45}{2\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ and $AD=BC=\\frac{27}{\\sqrt{2}}$ .

We can substitute in $n = \\frac{6}{5}m$ to get\n\n$BD = \\sqrt{m^2-100} + \\sqrt{(\\frac{6}{5}m)^2-100}$ .\n\nWe have \\[\\frac{1}{2}(10)\\left(\\sqrt{m^2-100} + \\sqrt{(\\frac{6}{5}m)^2-100}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(18)(m)\\] After a fairly straightforward algebraic bash, we get $m = \\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ , and $n = (\\frac{6}{5})(\\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4}) = \\frac{27\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle ADF$ , $DF^2 = n^2 - 18^2 = \\frac{729}{2} - 324 = \\frac{81}{2}$ , and $DF = \\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ .\n\nThus, $DC = 2DF + AB = 9\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{81\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ . Therefore, $K = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4}+\\frac{81\\sqrt{2}}{4}) \\cdot 18 = \\frac{63\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot 18 = \\frac{567\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . The requested answer is $K \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{567}$ .\n\n~ adam_zheng"}

Note also that $a_{2}=\\tfrac{2038}{2040}=\\tfrac{1019}{1020}=\\tfrac{t}{t+1}$ for $t=1019$ . Then $a_{2+q}=\\tfrac{1019+18q}{1020+19q}$ unless $1019+18q$ and $1020+19q$ are not relatively prime which happens when $q+1$ divides $18q+1019$ (by the Euclidean Algorithm), or $q+1$ divides $1001$ . Thus, the least value of $q$ is $6$ and $j=2+6=8$ . We know $a_{8}=\\tfrac{1019+108}{1020+114}=\\tfrac{1127}{1134}=\\tfrac{161}{162}$ . Now $a_{8+q}=\\tfrac{161+18q}{162+19q}$ unless $18q+161$ and $19q+162$ are not relatively prime which happens the first time $q+1$ divides $18q+161$ or $q+1$ divides $143$ or $q=10$ , and $j=8+10=18$ . We have $a_{18}=\\tfrac{161+180}{162+190}=\\tfrac{341}{352}=\\tfrac{31}{32}$ . Now $a_{18+q}=\\tfrac{31+18q}{32+19q}$ unless $18q+31$ and $19q+32$ are not relatively prime. This happens the first time $q+1$ divides $18q+31$ implying $q+1$ divides $13$ , which is prime so $q=12$ and $j=18+12=30$ . We have $a_{30}=\\tfrac{31+216}{32+228}=\\tfrac{247}{260}=\\tfrac{19}{20}$ . We have $a_{30+q}=\\tfrac{18q+19}{19q+20}$ , which is always reduced by EA, so the sum of all $j$ is $1+2+8+18+30=\\boxed{059}$ .\n\n~sugar_rush\n\nRemark 1\n\nWhenever a fraction is in the form $\\frac{t}{t+1}$ in lowest terms, the difference between the numerator and the denominator in the original fraction will always divide the numerator. We can model $a_j$ as $\\frac{m+18k}{m+19k+1}$ (not necessarily simplified) if $a_{j-k}=\\frac{m}{m+1}$ for integers $j$ and $k$ . We want the least $k$ such that $\\gcd(k+1,{m+18k})\\neq1$ . Let $d$ be a divisor of both $k+1$ and $m+18k$ , then $d\\mid18k+18$ , so $d\\mid{m-18}$ . This follows from the Euclidean Algorithm.\n\n~ Magnetoninja\n\nRemark 2\n\nThe reason we look for the least $q$ in each case is because after that $q$ or $j$ value, the fraction will simplify to $m/n$ again and it won't follow the condition we defined. For example, in the $a_{2+q}=\\tfrac{1019+18q}{1020+19q}$ case, after $j = 8$ , the equation becomes useless because the fraction has simplified to something different, so we \"switch over\" to $a_{8+q}=\\tfrac{161+18q}{162+19q}.$\n\n~ grogg007\n\nSolution 2 (Euclidean Algorithm and Generalization):\nLet $a_{j_1}, a_{j_2}, a_{j_3}, \\ldots, a_{j_u}$ be all terms in the form $\\frac{t}{t+1},$ where $j_1<j_2<j_3<\\cdots<j_u,$ and $t$ is some positive integer.\n\nWe wish to find $\\sum_{i=1}^{u}{j_i}.$ Suppose $a_{j_i}=\\frac{m}{m+1}$ for some positive integer $m.$\n\nTo find $\\boldsymbol{a_{j_{i+1}},}$ we look for the smallest positive integer $\\boldsymbol{k'}$ for which \\[\\boldsymbol{a_{j_{i+1}}=a_{j_i+k'}=\\frac{m+18k'}{m+1+19k'}}\\] is reducible:\n\nIf $\\frac{m+18k'}{m+1+19k'}$ is reducible, then there exists a common factor $d>1$ for $m+18k'$ and $m+1+19k'.$ By the Euclidean Algorithm , we have \\begin{align*} d\\mid m+18k' \\text{ and } d\\mid m+1+19k' &\\implies d\\mid m+18k' \\text{ and } d\\mid k'+1 \\\\ &\\implies d\\mid m-18 \\text{ and } d\\mid k'+1. \\end{align*} Since $m-18$ and $k'+1$ are not relatively prime, and $m$ is fixed, the smallest value of $k'$ such that $\\frac{m+18k'}{m+1+19k'}$ is reducible occurs when $k'+1$ is the smallest prime factor of $m-18.$\n\nWe will prove that for such value of $\\boldsymbol{k',}$ the number $\\boldsymbol{a_{j_{i+1}}}$ can be written in the form $\\boldsymbol{\\frac{t}{t+1}:}$ \\[a_{j_{i+1}}=a_{j_i+k'}=\\frac{m+18k'}{m+1+19k'}=\\frac{(m-18)+18(k'+1)}{(m-18)+19(k'+1)}=\\frac{\\frac{m-18}{k'+1}+18}{\\frac{m-18}{k'+1}+19}, \\hspace{10mm} (*)\\] where $t=\\frac{m-18}{k'+1}+18$ must be a positive integer.\n\nWe start with $m=2020$ and $a_{j_1}=a_1=\\frac{2020}{2021},$ then find $a_{j_2}, a_{j_3}, \\ldots, a_{j_u}$ by filling out the table below recursively: \\[\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c}  & & & & & \\\\ [-2ex] \\boldsymbol{i} & \\boldsymbol{m} & \\boldsymbol{m-18} & \\boldsymbol{k'+1} & \\boldsymbol{k'} & \\boldsymbol{a_{j_{i+1}} \\left(\\textbf{by } (*)\\right)} \\\\ [0.5ex]  \\hline   & & & & & \\\\ [-1.5ex]  1 & 2020 & 2002 & 2 & 1 & \\hspace{4.25mm} a_2 = \\frac{1019}{1020} \\\\ [1ex]      2 & 1019 & 1001 & 7 & 6 & \\hspace{2.75mm} a_8 = \\frac{161}{162} \\\\ [1ex]     3 & 161 & 143 & 11 & 10 & a_{18} = \\frac{31}{32} \\\\ [1ex] 4 & 31 & 13 & 13 & 12 & a_{30} = \\frac{19}{20} \\\\ [1ex] 5 & 19 & 1 & \\text{N/A} & \\text{N/A} & \\text{N/A} \\\\ [1ex] \\end{array}\\] As $\\left(j_1,j_2,j_3,j_4,j_5\\right)=(1,2,8,18,30),$ the answer is $\\sum_{i=1}^{5}{j_i}=\\boxed{059}.$\n\nRemark\n\nAlternatively, from $(*)$ we can set \\[\\frac{m+18k'}{m+1+19k'}=\\frac{t}{t+1}.\\] We cross-multiply, rearrange, and apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to get \\[\\left(k'+1\\right)(t-18)=m-18.\\] Since $k'+1\\geq2,$ to find the smallest $k',$ we need $k'+1$ to be the smallest prime factor of $m-18.$ Now we continue with the last two paragraphs of the solution above.\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM"}

From the Converse of the Inscribed Angle Theorem, quadrilaterals $ABA_1B_1,BCC_1B_1,CDC_1D_1,$ and $DAA_1D_1$ are all cyclic.\n\nSuppose $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{BD}$ intersect at $E,$ and let $\\angle AEB=\\theta.$ It follows that $\\angle CED=\\theta$ and $\\angle BEC=\\angle DEA=180^\\circ-\\theta.$\n\nWe obtain the following diagram: [asy] /* Made by MRENTHUSIASM */ size(300);  pair A, B, C, D, A1, B1, C1, D1, P, M1, M2; A = origin; C = (sqrt(53041)/31,0); B = intersectionpoints(Circle(A,4),Circle(C,5))[0]; D = intersectionpoints(Circle(A,7),Circle(C,6))[1]; A1 = foot(A,B,D); C1 = foot(C,B,D); B1 = foot(B,A,C); D1 = foot(D,A,C); P = intersectionpoint(A--C,B--D); M1 = midpoint(A--B); M2 = midpoint(C--D); markscalefactor=0.025; draw(rightanglemark(A,A1,B),red); draw(rightanglemark(B,B1,A),red); draw(rightanglemark(C,C1,D),red); draw(rightanglemark(D,D1,C),red); draw(Arc(M1,A,B)^^Arc(M2,C,D),blue); draw(A1--B1--C1--D1--cycle,green); dot(\"$A$\",A,1.5*W,linewidth(4)); dot(\"$B$\",B,1.5*dir(180-aCos(11/59)),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$C$\",C,1.5*E,linewidth(4)); dot(\"$D$\",D,1.5*dir(-aCos(11/59)),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$A_1$\",A1,1.5*dir(A1-A),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$B_1$\",B1,1.5*S,linewidth(4)); dot(\"$C_1$\",C1,1.5*dir(C1-C),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$D_1$\",D1,1.5*N,linewidth(4)); dot(\"$E$\",P,dir((180-aCos(11/59))/2),linewidth(4)); label(\"$\\theta$\",P,dir(180-aCos(11/59)/2),red); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle^^A--C^^B--D^^circumcircle(A,B,C)); draw(A--A1^^B--B1^^C--C1^^D--D1,dashed); [/asy] In every cyclic quadrilateral, each pair of opposite angles is supplementary.

\\begin{align*} 2\\cdot AE\\cdot BE\\cdot\\cos\\theta+2\\cdot BE\\cdot CE\\cdot\\cos\\theta+2\\cdot CE\\cdot DE\\cdot\\cos\\theta+2\\cdot DE\\cdot AE\\cdot\\cos\\theta&=22 \\\\

2\\cdot\\cos\\theta\\cdot59&=22 \\\\ \\cos\\theta&=\\frac{11}{59}. \\end{align*} Finally, substituting this result into $(\\bigstar)$ gives $22\\cos\\theta=\\frac{242}{59},$ from which the answer is $242+59=\\boxed{301}.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM (credit given to Math Jams's 2021 AIME I Discussion )\n\nSolution 1.2 (Area Formulas):\nLet the brackets denote areas.\nWe find $[ABCD]$ in two different ways:\n\nNote that $\\sin(180^\\circ-\\theta)=\\sin\\theta$ holds for all $\\theta.$ By area addition, we get \\begin{align*} [ABCD]&=[ABE]+[BCE]+[CDE]+[DAE] \\\\ &=\\frac12\\cdot AE\\cdot BE\\cdot\\sin\\angle AEB+\\frac12\\cdot BE\\cdot CE\\cdot\\sin\\angle BEC+\\frac12\\cdot CE\\cdot DE\\cdot\\sin\\angle CED+\\frac12\\cdot DE\\cdot AE\\cdot\\sin\\angle DEA \\\\ &=\\frac12\\cdot

&=\\frac12\\cdot\\sin\\theta\\cdot(\\phantom{ }\\underbrace{AE\\cdot BE+BE\\cdot CE+CE\\cdot DE+DE\\cdot AE}_{\\text{Use the result from }\\textbf{Remark}\\text{.}}\\phantom{ }) \\\\ &=\\frac12\\cdot\\sin\\theta\\cdot59. \\end{align*} By Brahmagupta's Formula, we get \\[[ABCD]=\\sqrt{(s-AB)(s-BC)(s-CD)(s-DA)}=2\\sqrt{210},\\] where $s=\\frac{AB+BC+CD+DA}{2}=11$ is the semiperimeter of $ABCD.$\n\nEquating the expressions for $[ABCD],$ we have \\[\\frac12\\cdot\\sin\\theta\\cdot59=2\\sqrt{210},\\] so $\\sin\\theta=\\frac{4\\sqrt{210}}{59}.$ Since $0^\\circ<\\theta<90^\\circ,$ we have $\\cos\\theta>0.$ It follows that \\[\\cos\\theta=\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2\\theta}=\\frac{11}{59}.\\] Finally, substituting this result into $(\\bigstar)$ gives $22\\cos\\theta=\\frac{242}{59},$ from which the answer is $242+59=\\boxed{301}.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM (credit given to Leonard my dude)\n\nSolution 2 (Finding cos x):\nThe angle $\\theta$ between diagonals satisfies \\[\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{(s-b)(s-d)}{(s-a)(s-c)}}\\] (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_quadrilateral#Angle_formulas ).\nThus, \\[\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{(11-4)(11-6)}{(11-5)(11-7)}}\\text{ or }\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{(11-5)(11-7)}{(11-4)(11-6)}}.\\] That is, $\\tan^2{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\frac{1-\\cos^2{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}}{\\cos^2{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}}=\\frac{24}{35}$ or $\\frac{35}{24}$ . Thus, $\\cos^2{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\frac{35}{59}$ or $\\frac{24}{59}$ . So, \\[\\cos{\\theta}=2\\cos^2{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}-1=\\pm\\frac{11}{59}.\\] In this context, $\\cos{\\theta}>0$ . Thus, $\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{11}{59}$ . The perimeter of $A_1B_1C_1D_1$ is \\[22\\cdot\\cos{\\theta}=22\\cdot\\frac{11}{59}=\\frac{242}{59},\\] and the answer is $m+n=242+59=\\boxed{301}$ .\n\n~y.grace.yu\n\nSolution 3 (Pythagorean Theorem):\nWe assume that the two quadrilateral mentioned in the problem are similar (due to both of them being cyclic). Note that by Ptolemy’s, one of the diagonals has length $\\sqrt{4 \\cdot 6 + 5 \\cdot 7} = \\sqrt{59}.$ [I don't believe this is correct... are the two diagonals of $ABCD$ necessarily congruent? -peace09]* WLOG we focus on diagonal $BD.$ To find the diagonal of the inner quadrilateral, we drop the altitude from $A$ and $C$ and calculate the length of $A_1C_1.$ Let $x$ be $A_1D$ (Thus $A_1B = \\sqrt{59} - x.$ By Pythagorean theorem, we have \\[49 - x^2 = 16 - \\left(\\sqrt{59} - x\\right)^2 \\implies 92 = 2\\sqrt{59}x \\implies x = \\frac{46}{\\sqrt{59}} = \\frac{46\\sqrt{59}}{59}.\\] Now let $y$ be $C_1D.$ (thus making $C_1B = \\sqrt{59} - y$ ). Similarly, we have \\[36 - y^2 = 25 - \\left(\\sqrt{59} - y\\right)^2 \\implies 70 = 2\\sqrt{59}y \\implies y = \\frac{35}{\\sqrt{59}} = \\frac{35\\sqrt{59}}{59}.\\] We see that $A_1C_1$ , the scaled down diagonal is just $x - y = \\frac{11\\sqrt{59}}{59},$ which is $\\frac{\\frac{11\\sqrt{59}}{59}}{\\sqrt{59}} = \\frac{11}{59}$ times our original diagonal $BD,$ implying a scale factor of $\\frac{11}{59}.$ Thus, due to perimeters scaling linearly, the perimeter of the new quadrilateral is simply $\\frac{11}{59} \\cdot 22 = \\frac{242}{59},$ making our answer $242+59 = \\boxed{301}.$\n\n~fidgetboss_4000\n\n\\[\\] $*$ Indeed, the diagonals do not have length $\\sqrt{59}$ . However, here's why it works out: Let the length of diagonal BD be a. Then, by the same logic as given in the solution by fidgetboss_4000, $x=\\frac{33+a^{2}}{2a}$ , $y=\\frac{11+a^{2}}{2a}$ , so $x-y=\\frac{11}{a}$ . Then, why does dividing by a to get a ratio work? It's because the orientation of quadrilaterals is different! In other words, instead of diagonal BD corresponding to diagonal $B_1$ $D_1$ , it corresponds to diagonal $A_1$ $C_1$ . Thus, to get the right ratio, we can find the ratio of the multiplied diagonals, then take the square root (this square root part is crucial. It happens because we essentially are taking something two-dimensional on the numerator and denominator, so to make it a one-dimensional similarity ratio, we must take the square root to half the dimension on each part). This yields $\\sqrt{\\frac{121}{a^{2}\\cdot b^{2}}}$ = $\\frac{11}{a\\cdot b}$ . However, by Ptolemy, $a\\cdot b$ =59. Thus, the ratio is indeed $\\frac{11}{59}$ . ~MATH-TITAN\n\nSolution 4 (Symmetry):\nSolution\n\nAIME-I-2021-11a.png\n\nIn accordance with Claim 1, the ratios of pairs of one-color segments are the same and equal to $\\cos \\theta,$ where $\\theta$ is the acute angle between the diagonals. \\begin{align*}  s &= A'B' + B'C' + C'D' + D'A' \\\\    &= (AB + BC + CD + DA)\\cos \\theta \\\\    &= (a + b + c + d)\\cos \\theta \\\\    &= 22\\cos \\theta. \\end{align*} In accordance with Claim 2, \\begin{align*} 2(ac + bd)\\cos \\theta = |d^2 – c^2 + b^2 – a^2|.\\end{align*} \\[2 \\cdot 59 \\cos \\theta = |13 + 9|.\\] \\[s = 22\\cos \\theta = \\frac{22 \\cdot 11}{59} = \\frac{242}{59}.\\] Therefore, the answer is $242+59=\\boxed{301}.$\n\nClaim 1\n\nAIME-I-2021-11b.png\n\nIn the triangle $ABC$ , the points $B'$ and $C'$ are the bases of the heights dropped from the vertices $B$ and $C$ , respectively. $\\angle A = \\alpha$ . Then \\[B'C'=\\begin{cases} BC \\cos\\alpha, & \\textrm{if } \\alpha < 90^\\circ, \\\\ BC \\cos (180^\\circ – \\alpha), & \\textrm{if } \\alpha >90^\\circ. \\end{cases}=|BC\\cos{\\alpha}|\\]\n\nProof\n\nDenote the orthocenter by $A'$ . Quadrilateral $B'C'BC$ is inscribed in a circle with diameter $BC$ , so the marked $\\angle B = \\angle B'.$\n\nIf $\\alpha < 90^\\circ,$ the $\\triangle AB'C' \\sim \\triangle ABC,$ the similarity coefficient is $AC' : AC = \\cos \\alpha.$ So $B'C' : BC = \\cos \\alpha.$\n\nIf $\\alpha > 90^\\circ,$ the $\\triangle A'B'C' \\sim \\triangle A'BC,$ the similarity coefficient is $A'C' : A'C = \\cos (180^\\circ – \\alpha).$ So $B'C' : BC = \\cos (180^\\circ – \\alpha).$\n\nClaim 2\n\nAIME-I-2021-11c.png\n\nGiven an inscribed quadrilateral $ABCD$ with sides $AB = a, BC = b, CD = c,$ and $DA = d.$ Prove that the $\\angle \\theta < 90^\\circ$ between the diagonals is given by \\begin{align*} \\cos \\theta = \\frac {|d^2 – c^2 + b^2 – a^2|}{2(ac + bd)}.\\end{align*} Proof\n\nLet the point $B'$ be symmetric to $B$ with respect to the perpendicular bisector $AC.$ Then the quadrilateral $AB'CD$ is an inscribed one, $AB' = b, B'C = a.$\n\n\\[2 \\angle AEB = \\overset{\\Large\\frown} {AB}  + \\overset{\\Large\\frown} {CD}.\\] \\begin{align*} 2\\angle B'AD = \\overset{\\Large\\frown} {B'C} + \\overset{\\Large\\frown} {CD} = \\overset{\\Large\\frown} {AB} + \\overset{\\Large\\frown} {CD} \\implies \\angle AEB = \\angle B'AD\\end{align*}\n\nWe apply the Law of Cosines to $\\triangle AB'D$ and $\\triangle CB'D$ : \\begin{align*} B'D^2 = AD^2 + AB'^2 – 2 AD \\cdot AB' \\cos \\theta,\\end{align*} \\[B'D^2 = CD^2 + CB'^2 + 2 CD \\cdot CB' \\cos \\theta,\\] \\[d^2 + b^2 – 2 bd \\cos \\theta = c^2 + a^2 + 2ac \\cos \\theta,\\] \\[2(ac + bd) \\cos \\theta = |d^2 – c^2 + b^2 – a^2|.\\] vladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss"}

Without the loss of generality, assume that $a\\leq b\\leq c.$\n\nWe wish to find $E(4,4,4).$ Note that:\n\nAt any moment before the frogs stop jumping, the only possibilities for $(a,b,c)$ are $(4,4,4),(2,4,6),$ and $(2,2,8).$ $E(a,b,c)$ does not depend on the actual positions of the frogs, but depends on the distances between the frogs. At the end of each minute, each frog has $2$ outcomes. So, there are $2^3=8$ outcomes in total.\n\nWe have the following system of equations: \\begin{align*} E(4,4,4)&=1+\\frac{2}{8}E(4,4,4)+\\frac{6}{8}E(2,4,6), \\\\ E(2,4,6)&=1+\\frac{4}{8}E(2,4,6)+\\frac{1}{8}E(4,4,4)+\\frac{1}{8}E(2,2,8), \\\\ E(2,2,8)&=1+\\frac{2}{8}E(2,2,8)+\\frac{2}{8}E(2,4,6). \\end{align*} Rearranging and simplifying each equation, we get \\begin{align*} E(4,4,4)&=\\frac{4}{3}+E(2,4,6), &(1) \\\\ E(2,4,6)&=2+\\frac{1}{4}E(4,4,4)+\\frac{1}{4}E(2,2,8), &\\hspace{12.75mm}(2) \\\\ E(2,2,8)&=\\frac{4}{3}+\\frac{1}{3}E(2,4,6). &(3) \\end{align*} Substituting $(1)$ and $(3)$ into $(2),$ we obtain \\[E(2,4,6)=2+\\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\frac{4}{3}+E(2,4,6)\\right]+\\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\frac{4}{3}+\\frac{1}{3}E(2,4,6)\\right],\\] from which $E(2,4,6)=4.$ Substituting this into $(1)$ gives $E(4,4,4)=\\frac{16}{3}.$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $16+3=\\boxed{019}.$\n\n~Ross Gao ~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSolution 2 (Markov Chain):\nMain article: Markov Chains\n\nWe can solve the problem by removing $1$ frog, and calculate the expected time for the remaining $2$ frogs. In the original problem, when the movement stops, $2$ of the $3$ frogs meet. Because the $3$ frogs cannot meet at one vertex, the probability that those two specific frogs meet is $\\tfrac13$ . If the expected time for the two frog problem is $E'$ , then the expected time for the original problem is $\\tfrac 13 E'$ .\n\nThe distance between the two frogs can only be $0$ , $2$ , $4$ , $6$ . We use the distances as the states to draw the following Markov Chain . This Markov Chain is much simpler than that of Solution 1 Supplement in the Remark section.\n\nAIME-I-2021-12a.png\n\n\\begin{align*} E(2) &= 1 + \\frac12 \\cdot E(2) + \\frac14 \\cdot E(4)\\\\ E(4) &= 1 + \\frac14 \\cdot E(2) + \\frac12 \\cdot E(4) + \\frac14 \\cdot E(6)\\\\ E(6) &= 1 + \\frac12 \\cdot E(4) + \\frac12 \\cdot E(6) \\end{align*}\n\nBy solving the above system of equations, $E(4) = 16$ . The answer for the original problem is $\\frac{16}{3}$ , $16 + 3 = \\boxed{\\textbf{019}}$\n\n~ isabelchen\n\nSolution 1 Supplement:\nSolution 1 can be represented by the following Markov Chain :\n\nAIME-I-2021-12b.png\n\nFrom state $(4, 4, 4)$ to state $(4, 4, 4)$ : the $3$ frogs must jump in the same direction, $2 \\cdot \\frac18 = \\frac14$ .\n\nFrom state $(4, 4, 4)$ to state $(2, 4, 6)$ : $2$ frogs must jump in the same direction, and the other must jump in the opposite direction, $\\binom32 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac18 = \\frac34$ .\n\nFrom state $(2, 4, 6)$ to state $(4, 4, 4)$ : the $2$ frogs with a distance of $4$ in between must jump in the same direction so that they will be further away from the other frog, and the other frog must jump in the opposite direction as those $2$ frogs, $\\frac18$ .\n\nFrom state $(2, 4, 6)$ to state $(2, 4, 6)$ : the $3$ frogs can all jump in the same direction; or the $2$ frogs with a distance of $2$ in between jumps away from each other and the other frog jumps closer to the closest frog; or the $2$ frogs with a distance of $6$ in between jump closer to each other and away from the third frog, the third frog jumps closer to the closest frog; $(2 + 1 + 1) \\cdot \\frac18 = \\frac12$ .\n\nFrom state $(2, 4, 6)$ to state $(2, 2, 8)$ : the $2$ frogs with a distance of $2$ in between must jump closer to the other frog and the other frog must jump close to those $2$ frogs, $\\frac18$ .\n\nFrom state $(2, 2, 8)$ to state $(2, 4, 6)$ : $2$ frogs that have no frogs in between must both jump in the same direction away from the other frog, the other frog must also jump away from those $2$ frogs, $2 \\cdot \\frac18 = \\frac14$ .\n\nFrom state $(2, 2, 8)$ to state $(2, 2, 8)$ : the $3$ frogs must all jump in the same direction, $2 \\cdot \\frac18 = \\frac14$ .\n\nFrom state $(2, 2, 8)$ to state $(0, x, y)$ : frogs with a distance of $2$ must jump closer to each other, the other frog can jump in any direction, $\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 \\cdot 2 = \\frac12$ .\n\nFrom state $(2, 4, 6)$ to state $(0, x, y)$ : the frogs with a distance of $2$ must jump closer to each other, the other frog can jump in any direction, $\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 = \\frac14$ .\n\nBecause $a + b + c = 12$ , we can use $(a, b)$ to represent the states which is simpler than using $(a, b, c)$ in Solution 1."}

Now we can solve for $O_1X$ and $O_2X$ , and in particular, \\begin{align*} O_1H &= O_1X - HX = \\frac{d+\\frac{r_1^2-r_2^2}{d}}{2} - \\frac{r}{2} \\\\ O_2H &= O_2X + HX = \\frac{d-\\frac{r_1^2-r_2^2}{d}}{2} + \\frac{r}{2}.  \\end{align*} We want to solve for $d$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem (twice): \\begin{align*} &\\qquad -OH^2 = O_2H^2 - (r+r_2)^2 = O_1H^2 - (r+r_1)^2 \\\\ &\\implies \\left(d+r-\\tfrac{r_1^2-r_2^2}{d}\\right)^2 - 4(r+r_2)^2 = \\left(d-r+\\tfrac{r_1^2-r_2^2}{d}\\right)^2 - 4(r+r_1)^2 \\\\ &\\implies 2dr - 2(r_1^2-r_2^2)-8rr_2-4r_2^2 = -2dr+2(r_1^2-r_2^2)-8rr_1-4r_1^2 \\\\ &\\implies 4dr = 8rr_2-8rr_1 \\\\ &\\implies d=2r_2-2r_1 \\end{align*} Therefore, $d=2(r_2-r_1) = 2(961-625)=\\boxed{672}$ .\n\nSolution 2 (Linearity):\nLet $O_{1}$ , $O_{2}$ , and $O$ be the centers of $\\omega_{1}$ , $\\omega_{2}$ , and $\\omega$ with $r_{1}$ , $r_{2}$ , and $r$ their radii, respectively. Then, the distance from $O$ to the radical axis $\\ell\\equiv\\overline{AB}$ of $\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}r$ . Let $x=O_{1}O_{2}$ and $O^{\\prime}$ the orthogonal projection of $O$ onto line $\\ell$ . Define the function $f:\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ by \\[f(X)=\\text{Pow}_{\\omega_{1}}(X)-\\text{Pow}_{\\omega_{2}}(X).\\] Then \\begin{align*} f(O_{1})=-r_{1}^{2}-(x-r_{2})(x+r_{2})&=-x^{2}+r_{2}^{2}-r_{1}^{2}, \\\\ f(O_{2})=(x-r_{1})(x+r_{1})-(-r_{2}^{2})&=x^{2}+r_{2}^{2}-r_{1}^{2}, \\\\ f(O)=r(r+2r_{1})-r(r+2r_{2})&=2r(r_{1}-r_{2}), \\\\ f(O^{\\prime})&=0. \\end{align*} By linearity , \\[\\frac{f(O_{2})-f(O_{1})}{f(O)-f(O^{\\prime})}=\\frac{O_{1}O_{2}}{OO^{\\prime}}=\\frac{x}{\\tfrac{1}{2}r}=\\frac{2x}{r}.\\] Notice that $f(O_{2})-f(O_{1})=x^{2}-(-x^{2})=2x^{2}$ and $f(O)-f(O^{\\prime})=2r(r_{1}-r_{2})$ , thus \\begin{align*}\\frac{2x^{2}}{2r(r_{1}-r_{2})}&=\\frac{2x}{r}\\end{align*} Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2x}{r}$ (which is obviously nonzero as $x$ is nonzero) gives us \\begin{align*}\\frac{x}{2(r_{1}-r_{2})}&=1\\end{align*} so $x=2(r_{1}-r_{2})$ . Since $r_{1}=961$ and $r_{2}=625$ , the answer is $x=2\\cdot(961-625)=\\boxed{672}$ .\n\nSolution 3:\nDenote by $O_1$ , $O_2$ , and $O$ the centers of $\\omega_1$ , $\\omega_2$ , and $\\omega$ , respectively. Let $R_1 = 961$ and $R_2 = 625$ denote the radii of $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ respectively, $r$ be the radius of $\\omega$ , and $\\ell$ the distance from $O$ to the line $AB$ . We claim that \\[\\dfrac{\\ell}{r} = \\dfrac{R_2-R_1}{d},\\] where $d = O_1O_2$ .

Since $\\sigma(a^n)-1$ is divisible by $2021$ for all positive integers $a$ , we can first consider the special case where $a$ is prime and $a \\neq 0,1 \\pmod{43}$ . By Dirichlet's Theorem (Refer to the Remark section.), such $a$ always exists.\n\nThen $\\sigma(a^n)-1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n a^i = a\\left(\\frac{a^n - 1}{a-1}\\right)$ . In order for this expression to be divisible by $2021=43\\cdot 47$ , a necessary condition is $a^n - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$ . By Fermat's Little Theorem , $a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}$ . Moreover, if $a$ is a primitive root modulo $43$ , then $\\text{ord}_{43}(a) = 42$ , so $n$ must be divisible by $42$ .\n\nBy similar reasoning, $n$ must be divisible by $46$ , by considering $a \\not\\equiv 0,1 \\pmod{47}$ .\n\nWe next claim that $n$ must be divisible by $43$ . By Dirichlet, let $a$ be a prime that is congruent to $1 \\pmod{43}$ . Then $\\sigma(a^n) \\equiv n+1 \\pmod{43}$ , so since $\\sigma(a^n)-1$ is divisible by $43$ , $n$ is a multiple of $43$ .\n\nAlternatively, since $\\left(\\frac{a(a^n - 1^n)}{a-1}\\right)$ must be divisible by $43,$ by LTE, we have $v_{43}(a)+v_{43}{(a-1)}+v_{43}{(n)}-v_{43}{(a-1)} \\geq 1,$ which simplifies to $v_{43}(n) \\geq 1,$ which implies the desired result.\n\nSimilarly, $n$ is a multiple of $47$ .\n\nLastly, we claim that if $n = \\text{lcm}(42, 46, 43, 47)$ , then $\\sigma(a^n) - 1$ is divisible by $2021$ for all positive integers $a$ . The claim is trivially true for $a=1$ so suppose $a>1$ . Let $a = p_1^{e_1}\\ldots p_k^{e_k}$ be the prime factorization of $a$ . Since $\\sigma(n)$ is multiplicative , we have \\[\\sigma(a^n) - 1 = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\sigma(p_i^{e_in}) - 1.\\] We can show that $\\sigma(p_i^{e_in}) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2021}$ for all primes $p_i$ and integers $e_i \\ge 1$ , so \\[\\sigma(p_i^{e_in}) = 1 + (p_i + p_i^2 + \\ldots + p_i^n) + (p_i^{n+1} + \\ldots + p_i^{2n}) + \\ldots + (p_i^{n(e_i-1)+1} + \\ldots + p_i^{e_in}),\\] where each expression in parentheses contains $n$ terms. It is easy to verify that if $p_i = 43$ or $p_i = 47$ then $\\sigma(p_i^{e_in}) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2021}$ for this choice of $n$ , so suppose $p_i \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$ and $p_i \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{47}$ . Each expression in parentheses equals $\\frac{p_i^n - 1}{p_i - 1}$ multiplied by some power of $p_i$ . If $p_i \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}$ , then FLT implies $p_i^n - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$ , and if $p_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}$ , then $p_i + p_i^2 + \\ldots + p_i^n \\equiv 1 + 1 + \\ldots + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$ (since $n$ is also a multiple of $43$ , by definition). Similarly, we can show $\\sigma(p_i^{e_in}) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$ , and a simple CRT argument shows $\\sigma(p_i^{e_in}) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2021}$ . Then $\\sigma(a^n) \\equiv 1^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2021}$ .\n\nThen the prime factors of $n$ are $2,3,7,23,43,$ and $47,$ and the answer is $2+3+7+23+43+47 = \\boxed{125}$ .\n\n~scrabbler94, Revised by wzs26843545602\n\nSolution 2 (Along the Lines of Solution 1):\n$n$ only needs to satisfy $\\sigma(a^n)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}$ and $\\sigma(a^n)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}$ for all $a$ . Let's work on the first requirement (mod 43) first. All $n$ works for $a=1$ . If $a>1$ , let $a$ 's prime factorization be $a=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ . The following three statements are the same:\n\nFor all $a$ , we have $\\sigma(a^n)=\\prod_{i=1}^k(1+p_i+\\cdots+p_i^{ne_i})\\equiv1\\pmod{43}$ . For all $e>0$ and prime $p$ , we have $1+p+\\cdots+p^{ne}\\equiv1\\pmod{43}$ . For all prime $p$ , we have $p+p^2+\\cdots+p^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$ .\n\nWe can show this by casework on $p$ :\n\nFor $p\\equiv0\\pmod{43}$ , no matter what $n$ is, it is true that \\[p+p^2+\\cdots+p^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}.\\] For all $p\\equiv1\\pmod{43}$ , it is true that \\[p+p^2+\\cdots+p^n \\equiv n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}.\\] One can either use brute force or Dirichlet's Theorem to show such $p$ exists. Therefore, $43|n$ . For all $p\\not\\equiv0,1\\pmod{43}$ , it is true that \\[p+p^2+\\cdots+p^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43} \\Leftrightarrow p^n-1\\equiv0\\pmod{43}.\\] According to Fermat's Little Theorem, $42|n$ is sufficient. To show it's necessary, we just need to show $43$ has a prime primitive root. This can be done either by brute force or as follows. $43$ is prime and it must have a primitive root $t\\neq 1$ that's coprime to $43$ . All numbers of the form $43k+t$ are also primitive roots of $43$ . According to Dirichlet's Theorem there must be infinitely many primes among them.\n\nSimilar arguments for modulo $47$ lead to $46|n$ and $47|n$ . Therefore, we get $n=\\operatorname{lcm}[42,43,46,47]$ . Following the last paragraph of Solution 1 gives the answer $\\boxed{125}$ .\n\n~Mryang6859 (Solution)\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM (Reformatting)\n\nSolution 3 (Casework):\nWe perform casework on $a:$\n\n$a=1.$ For all positive integers $n,$ we have $\\sigma\\left(a^n\\right)-1=0.$ $a$ is a prime number. For all prime numbers $p,$ note that \\[\\sigma\\left(p^n\\right)-1=\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{n}p^i\\right)-1=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}p^i=\\frac{p^{n+1}-p}{p-1}=\\frac{p\\left(p^n-1\\right)}{p-1}\\] by geometric series. Recall that $2021=43\\cdot47.$ Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we get the following system of congruences: \\begin{align*} \\frac{p\\left(p^n-1\\right)}{p-1}&\\equiv0\\pmod{43}, &(1)\\\\ \\frac{p\\left(p^n-1\\right)}{p-1}&\\equiv0\\pmod{47}. &(2) \\end{align*} We perform casework on $(1):$ $p-1\\not\\equiv0\\pmod{43}.$ We need $p\\left(p^n-1\\right)\\equiv0\\pmod{43}.$ If $p=43,$ then this congruence is true for all positive integers $n.$ If $p\\neq43,$ then this congruence becomes $p^n-1\\equiv0\\pmod{43}.$ By Fermat's Little Theorem, we obtain $n\\equiv0\\pmod{42}.$ $p-1\\equiv0\\pmod{43}.$ We need $p^n-1$ to contain more factors of $43$ than $p-1$ does. More generally, for all positive integers $k,$ if $p-1\\equiv0 \\ \\left(\\operatorname{mod} \\ 43^k\\right),$ then $p^n-1\\equiv0 \\ \\left(\\operatorname{mod} \\ 43^{k+1}\\right).$ Let $p=43^km+1$ for some positive integer $m$ such that $m\\not\\equiv0\\pmod{43}.$ We substitute this into $p^n-1\\equiv0 \\ \\left(\\operatorname{mod} \\ 43^{k+1}\\right)$ and apply the Binomial Theorem: \\begin{align*} \\left(43^km+1\\right)^n-1&\\equiv0 \\ \\left(\\operatorname{mod} \\ 43^{k+1}\\right) \\\\ \\Biggl[\\binom{n}{0}\\left(43^km\\right)^0+\\binom{n}{1}\\left(43^km\\right)^1+\\phantom{ }\\underbrace{\\binom{n}{2}\\left(43^km\\right)^2+\\cdots+\\binom{n}{n}\\left(43^km\\right)^n}_{0 \\ \\left(\\operatorname{mod} \\ 43^{k+1}\\right)}\\phantom{ }\\Biggr]-1 &\\equiv0 \\ \\left(\\operatorname{mod} \\ 43^{k+1}\\right) \\\\ \\left[1+43^kmn\\right]-1&\\equiv0 \\ \\left(\\operatorname{mod} \\ 43^{k+1}\\right) \\\\ 43^kmn&\\equiv0 \\ \\left(\\operatorname{mod} \\ 43^{k+1}\\right), \\end{align*} from which $n\\equiv0\\pmod{43}.$ For $(1),$ we find that $n\\equiv0\\pmod{42}$ and $n\\equiv0\\pmod{43}.$ For $(2),$ we find that $n\\equiv0\\pmod{46}$ and $n\\equiv0\\pmod{47}$ by a similar argument. Together, we conclude that $n=\\operatorname{lcm}(42,43,46,47)$ is the least such positive integer $n$ for this case. $a$ is a composite number. Let $a=\\prod_{i=1}^{u}p_i^{e_i}$ be the prime factorization of $a.$ Note that $\\sigma(a)$ is a multiplicative function: \\[\\sigma(a)=\\sigma\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{u}p_i^{e_i}\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{u}\\sigma\\left(p_i^{e_i}\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{u}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{e_i}p_i^j\\right),\\] as this product of geometric series spans all positive divisors of $a.$ At $n=\\operatorname{lcm}(42,43,46,47),$ it follows that \\begin{align*} \\sigma\\left(a^n\\right)-1&=\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{u}\\sigma\\left(p_i^{e_in}\\right)\\right)-1 \\\\ &\\equiv\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{u}1\\right)-1 &&\\pmod{2021} \\\\ &\\equiv0 &&\\pmod{2021}. \\end{align*}\n\nFinally, the least such positive integer $n$ for all cases is \\begin{align*} n&=\\operatorname{lcm}(42,43,46,47) \\\\ &=\\operatorname{lcm}(2\\cdot3\\cdot7,43,2\\cdot23,47) \\\\ &=2\\cdot3\\cdot7\\cdot23\\cdot43\\cdot47, \\end{align*} so the sum of its prime factors is $2+3+7+23+43+47=\\boxed{125}.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM (inspired by Math Jams's 2021 AIME I Discussion )\n\nSolution 4 (Cheap):\nSince the problem works for all positive integers $a$ , let's plug in $a=2$ and see what we get. Since $\\sigma({2^n}) = 2^{n+1}-1,$ we have $2^{n+1} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{2021}.$ Simplifying using CRT and Fermat's Little Theorem , we get that $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{42}$ and $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{46}.$ Then, we can look at $a$ being a $1\\pmod{43}$ prime and a $1\\pmod{47}$ prime, just like in Solution 1, to find that $43$ and $47$ also divide $n$ . There don't seem to be any other odd \"numbers\" to check, so we can hopefully assume that the answer is the sum of the prime factors of $\\text{lcm(42, 43, 46, 47)}.$ From here, follow solution 1 to get the final answer $\\boxed{125}$ .\n\n~PureSwag\n\nSolution 5 (Similar to Solution 4 and USEMO 2019 Problem 4):\nWarning: This solution doesn't explain why $43*47\\mid n$ .\n\nIt says the problem implies that it works for all positive integers $a$ , we basically know that If $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$ , then from \"USEMO 2019 Problem 4\", if $p^n + p^{n-1} + \\cdots + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}$ , then \\[\\frac{p^{en+1}-1}{p-1} = p^{en} + p^{en-1} + \\cdots + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{q}.\\] From here we can just let $\\sigma(2^n)$ or be a power of $2$ which we can do \\[\\sigma(2^n)=1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4+\\cdots+2^n=2^{n+1}-1,\\] which is a geometric series. We can plug in $a=2$ like in Solution 4 and use CRT. We have the prime factorization $2021 = 43 \\cdot 47$ . We use CRT to find that \\begin{align*} 2^n &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}, \\\\ 2^n &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{47}. \\end{align*} We see that this is just FLT which is $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ we see that all multiples of $42$ will work for first and $46$ for the second. We can figure out that it is just $\\text{lcm}(43-1,47-1)\\cdot43\\cdot47$ which when we add up we get that it's just the sum of the prime factors of $\\text{lcm}(42,43,46,47)$ which you can just look at Solution 1 to find out the sum of the prime factors and get the answer $\\boxed{125}$ ."}

By a quick sketch, we have two subconditions: The point $(-k,20)$ is on or below the parabola $y=x^2-k.$ We need $20\\leq(-k)^2-k,$ from which $k\\geq5.$ Moreover, the point $(-k,20)$ is on the parabola $y=x^2-k$ when $k=5.$ We will prove that the two parabolas intersect at four distinct points at this value of $k:$ Substituting $y=x^2-5$ into $x=2(y-20)^2-5,$ we get $x=2\\left(\\left(x^2-5\\right)-20\\right)^2-5.$ Expanding and rearranging give \\[2x^4-100x^2-x+1245=0. \\hspace{20mm}(\\bigstar)\\] By either the graphs of the parabolas or the Rational Root Theorem, we conclude that $x=-5$ is a root of $(\\bigstar).$ So, we factor its left side: \\[(x+5)\\left(2x^3-10x^2-50x+249\\right)=0.\\] By either the graphs of the parabolas or Descartes' Rule of Signs, we conclude that $2x^3-10x^2-50x+249=0$ has two positive roots and one negative root such that $x\\neq-5.$ So, $(\\bigstar)$ has four distinct real roots, or the two parabolas intersect at four distinct points. For Subcondition A, we deduce that $k\\geq5.$ Remark for Subcondition A Recall that if $1\\leq k\\leq 4,$ then the point $(-k,20)$ is above the parabola $y=x^2-k.$ It follows that for $-k\\leq x\\leq0:$ The maximum value of $y$ for the parabola $y=x^2-k$ occurs at $x=-k,$ from which $y=k^2-k\\leq12.$ The minimum value of $y$ for the parabola $x=2(y-20)^2-k$ occurs at $x=0,$ from which $y=20-\\sqrt{\\frac k2}>18.$ Clearly, the parabola $x=2(y-20)^2-k$ and the left half of the parabola $y=x^2-k$ do not intersect. Therefore, the two parabolas do not intersect at four distinct points. The point $(0,-k)$ is on or below the parabola $x=2(y-20)^2-k.$ The lower half of the parabola $x=2(y-20)^2-k$ is $y=20-\\sqrt{\\frac{x+k}{2}}.$ We need $-k\\leq20-\\sqrt{\\frac k2},$ which holds for all values of $k.$ For Subcondition B, we deduce that $k$ can be any positive integer. For Condition 1, we obtain $\\boldsymbol{k\\geq5}$ by taking the intersection of Subconditions A and B. The four points of intersection lie on a circle with radius at most $21.$ For equations of circles, the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ must be the same. So, we add the equation $y=x^2-k$ to half the equation $x=2(y-20)^2-k:$ \\[y+\\frac12x=x^2+(y-20)^2-\\frac32k.\\] We expand, rearrange, and complete the squares: \\begin{align*} y+\\frac12x&=x^2+y^2-40y+400-\\frac32k \\\\ \\frac32k-400&=\\left(x^2-\\frac12x\\right)+\\left(y^2-41y\\right) \\\\ \\frac32k-400+\\frac{1}{16}+\\frac{1681}{4}&=\\left(x-\\frac14\\right)^2+\\left(y-\\frac{41}{2}\\right)^2. \\end{align*} We need $\\frac32k-400+\\frac{1}{16}+\\frac{1681}{4}\\leq21^2,$ from which $k\\leq\\left\\lfloor\\frac{6731}{24}\\right\\rfloor=280.$ For Condition 2, we obtain $\\boldsymbol{k\\leq280.}$\n\nTaking the intersection of Conditions 1 and 2 produces $5\\leq k\\leq280.$ Therefore, the answer is $5+280=\\boxed{285}.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSolution 2 (Translations, Inequalities, Circles):\nMake the translation $y \\rightarrow y+20$ to obtain $20+y=x^2-k$ and $x=2y^2-k$ . Multiply the first equation by $2$ and sum, we see that $2(x^2+y^2)=3k+40+2y+x$ . Completing the square gives us $\\left(y- \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(x - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{325+24k}{16}$ ; this explains why the two parabolas intersect at four points that lie on a circle*. For the upper bound, observe that $LHS \\leq 21^2=441 \\rightarrow 24k \\leq 6731$ , so $k \\leq 280$ .\n\nFor the lower bound, we need to ensure there are $4$ intersections to begin with. (Here I'm using the un-translated coordinates.) Draw up a graph, and realize that two intersections are guaranteed, on the so called \"right branch\" of $y=x^2-k$ . As we increase the value of $k$ , two more intersections appear on the \"left branch\":\n\n$k=4$ does not work because the \"leftmost\" point of $x=2(y-20)^2-4$ is $(-4,20)$ which lies to the right of $\\left(-\\sqrt{24}, 20\\right)$ , which is on the graph $y=x^2-4$ . While technically speaking this doesn't prove that there are no intersections (why?), drawing the graph should convince you that this is the case. Clearly, $k<4$ does not work.\n\n$k=5$ does work because the two graphs intersect at $(-5,20)$ , and by drawing the graph, you realize this is not a tangent point and there is in fact another intersection nearby, due to slope. Therefore, the answer is $5+280=\\boxed{285}$ .\n\nIn general (assuming four intersections exist), when two conics intersect, if one conic can be written as $ax^2+by^2=f(x,y)$ and the other as $cx^2+dy^2=g(x,y)$ for polynomials $f$ and $g$ of degree at most $1$ , whenever $(a,b),(c,d)$ are linearly independent (L.I.), we can combine the two equations and then complete the square to achieve $(x-p)^2+(y-q)^2=r^2$ . We can also combine these two equations to form a parabola, or a hyperbola, or an ellipse. When $(a,b),(c,d)$ are not L.I., the intersection points instead lie on a line, which is a circle of radius infinity. When the two conics only have $3,2$ or $1$ intersection point(s), the statement that all these points lie on a circle is trivially true.\n\n~Ross Gao\n\nSolution 3 (Parabola's Properties):\nClaim\n\n2021 AIME I 15a.png\n\nLet the axes of two parabolas be perpendicular, their focal parameters be $p_1$ and $p_2$ and the distances from the foci to the point of intersection of the axes be $x_2$ and $y_1$ . Suppose that these parabolas intersect at four points.\n\nThen these points lie on the circle centered at point $(p_2, p_1)$ with radius $r = \\sqrt{2(p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_1 y_1 + p_2 x_2)}.$\n\nProof\n\nLet's introduce a coordinate system with the center at the point of intersection of the axes. Let the first (red) parabola have axis $x = 0,$ focal parameter $p_1$ and focus at point $A(0, –y_1), y_1 > 0.$ Let second (blue) parabola have axis $y = 0,$ focal parameter $p_2$ and focus at point $B(–x_2,0), x_2  > 0.$ Let us denote the angle between the vector connecting the focus of the first parabola and its point and the positive direction of the ordinate axis $2\\theta,$ its length $\\rho_1(\\theta),$ the angle between the vector connecting the focus of the second parabola and its point and the positive direction of the abscissa axis $2\\phi,$ its length $\\rho_2(\\phi).$ Then \\[\\rho_1(\\theta) = \\frac{p_1}{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}, \\rho_2(\\phi) = \\frac{p_2}{1 - \\cos(2\\phi)}.\\]\n\nAbscissa of the point of intersection is \\begin{align*} x =\\rho_1 \\sin(2\\theta) = p_1\\cot\\theta = \\rho_2 \\cos (2\\phi) - x_2 = \\frac{p_2}{2} (\\cot^2\\phi - 1)- x_2,\\end{align*} \\begin{align*} x^2 = p_1^2 \\cot ^2 \\theta , 2 p_1\\cot\\theta = p_2 \\cos^2 \\phi - p_2 - 2x_2 .\\end{align*} Ordinate of the point of intersection is \\begin{align*} y =\\rho_2 \\sin 2\\phi = p_2\\cot\\phi = \\rho_1 \\cos 2\\theta - y_1 = \\frac{p_1}{2} (\\cot^2\\theta - 1)- y_1,\\end{align*} \\begin{align*} y^2 = p_2^2 \\cot ^2 \\phi , 2 p_2\\cot\\phi = p_1 \\cos^2 \\theta - p_1 - 2y_1 .\\end{align*} The square of the distance from point of intersection to the point $(p_2, p_1)$ is \\begin{align*} r^2 = (x-p_2)^2 + (y-p_1)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2 p_1 y - 2 p_2 x + p_1^2 + p_2^2 .\\end{align*} After simple transformations, we get $r^2 = 2(p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_1 y_1 + p_2 x_2).$\n\nHence, any intersection point has the same distance $r$ from the point $(p_2, p_1).$\n\nSolution\n\nParameters of the parabola $y = x^2 – k$ are $p_1 = \\frac{1}{2}, y_1 = 20 + k – \\frac{1}{2}.$\n\nParameters of the parabola $\\frac{x}{2} = (y – 20)^2 – \\frac{k}{2}$ are $p_2 = \\frac{1}{4}, x_2 = k – \\frac{1}{4}  \\implies r^2 = 20 + \\frac{3k}{2}.$\n\nIf $r \\le 21, k \\le \\frac{842}{3},$ then integer $k \\le 280.$\n\nThe vertex of the second parabola is point $(– k,20)$ can be on the parabola $y = x^2 – k$ or below the point of the parabola with the same abscissa. So \\[20 \\ge (– k)^2 – k  \\implies   5 \\le k \\le 280.\\] Therefore, the answer is $5+280=\\boxed{285}$ .\n\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss"}

Therefore, we can pair each three-digit palindrome uniquely with another three-digit palindrome so that they sum to \\begin{align*} \\underline{ABA}+\\underline{(10-A)(9-B)(10-A)}&=\\left[100A+10B+A\\right]+\\left[100(10-A)+10(9-B)+(10-A)\\right] \\\\ &=\\left[100A+10B+A\\right]+\\left[1000-100A+90-10B+10-A\\right] \\\\ &=1000+90+10 \\\\ &=1100. \\end{align*} For instances: \\begin{align*} 171+929&=1100, \\\\ 262+838&=1100, \\\\ 303+797&=1100, \\\\ 414+686&=1100, \\\\ 545+555&=1100, \\end{align*} and so on.\n\nFrom this symmetry, the arithmetic mean of all the three-digit palindromes is $\\frac{1100}{2}=\\boxed{550}.$\n\nRemark\n\nBy the Multiplication Principle, there are $9\\cdot10=90$ three-digit palindromes in total. Their sum is $1100\\cdot45=49500,$ as we can match them into $45$ pairs such that each pair sums to $1100.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSolution 4 (Similar to Solution 2: Very, Very Easy and Quick):\nWe notice that a three-digit palindrome looks like this: $\\underline{aba}.$\n\nAnd we know $a$ can be any digit from $1$ through $9,$ and $b$ can be any digit from $0$ through $9,$ so there are $9\\times{10}=90$ three-digit palindromes.\n\nWe want to find the sum of these $90$ palindromes and divide it by $90$ to find the arithmetic mean.\n\nHow can we do that? Instead of adding the numbers up, we can break each palindrome into two parts: $101a+10b.$\n\nThus, all of these $90$ palindromes can be broken into this form.\n\nThus, the sum of these $90$ palindromes will be $101\\times{(1+2+...+9)}\\times{10}+10\\times{(0+1+2+...+9)}\\times{9},$ because each $a$ will be in $10$ different palindromes (since for each $a,$ there are $10$ choices for $b$ ). The same logic explains why we multiply by $9$ when computing the total sum of $b.$\n\nWe get a sum of $45\\times{1100},$ but don't compute this! Divide this by $90$ and you will get $\\boxed{550}.$\n\n~ $\\alpha b \\alpha$\n\nSolution 5 (Extremely Fast Solution):\nThe possible values of the first and last digits each are $1, 2, ..., 8, 9$ with a sum of $45$ so the average value is $5.$ The middle digit can be any digit from $0$ to $9$ with a sum of $45,$ so the average value is $4.5.$ The average of all three-digit palindromes is $5\\cdot 10^2+4.5\\cdot 10+5=\\boxed{550}.$\n\n~MathIsFun286\n\n~MathFun1000 (Rephrasing with more clarity)\n\nSolution 6 (Two cases):\nCase 1\n\nConsider palindromes of the form $5x5 = 505 + 10x.$ There are $10$ of them. The arithmetic mean of the first term is $505,$ and the second $\\frac {10 \\cdot(0 + 1 + ... + 9)}{10} = 45.$ The arithmetic mean of the sum is $505 + 45 = 550.$\n\nCase 2\n\nConsider palindromes of the form $yxy,$ where $y= {1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9}.$ Let $u = 10 – y, v = 9 – x.$ Then $uvu$ is a symmetric palindrome that can be constructed for each $yxy.$ The arithmetic mean of each such pair is $550.$ For example, $\\frac{737 + 363}{2} = 550.$\n\nThus, all palindromes are divided into groups of numbers with the arithmetic mean in each group equal to $550.$\n\nThe arithmetic mean of all numbers is also $550.$\n\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss"}

Solving the system of equations, we get $a = 20$ and $c = 1$ , so $P(x) = Q(x) = x^2 - 20x + 420$ .\n\nFinally, by the quadratic formula, we have roots of $\\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - 1680}}{2} = 10 \\pm \\sqrt{320}i$ , so our final answer is $10 + 320 = \\boxed{330}$\n\n-faefeyfa\n\nSolution 5 (Fast and Easy):\nWe plug -20 into the equation obtaining $(-20)^3-20a+b$ , likewise, plugging -21 into the second equation gets $(-21)^3+441c+d$ .\n\nBoth equations must have 3 solutions exactly, so the other two solutions must be $m + \\sqrt{n} \\cdot i$ and $m - \\sqrt{n} \\cdot i$ .\n\nBy Vieta's, the sum of the roots in the first equation is $0$ , so $m$ must be $10$ .\n\nNext, using Vieta's theorem on the second equation, you get $x1x2+x2x3+x1x3 = 0$ . However, since we know that the sum of the roots with complex numbers are 20, we can factor out the terms with -21, so $-21*(20)+(m^2+n)=0$ .\n\nGiven that $m$ is $10$ , then $n$ is equal to $320$ .\n\nTherefore, the answer to the equation is $\\boxed{330}$\n\nSolution 6 (solution byintegralarefun):\nSince $m+i\\sqrt{n}$ is a common root and all the coefficients are real, $m-i\\sqrt{n}$ must be a common root, too.\n\nNow that we know all three roots of both polynomials, we can match coefficients (or more specifically, the zero coefficients).\n\nFirst, however, the product of the two common roots is: \\begin{align*} &&&(x-m-i\\sqrt{n})(x-m+i\\sqrt{n})\\\\ &=&&x^2-x(m+i\\sqrt{n}+m-i\\sqrt{n})+(m+i\\sqrt{n})(m-i\\sqrt{n})\\\\ &=&&x^2-2xm+(m^2-i^2n)\\\\ &=&&x^2-2xm+m^2+n \\end{align*}\n\nNow, let's equate the two forms of both the polynomials: \\[x^3+ax+b=(x^2-2xm+m^2+n)(x+20)\\] \\[x^3+cx^2+d=(x^2-2xm+m^2+n)(x+21)\\] Now we can match the zero coefficients. \\[-2m+20=0\\to m=10\\text{ and}\\] \\[-42m+m^2+n=0\\to-420+100+n=0\\to n=320\\text{.}\\] Thus, $m+n=10+320=\\boxed{330}$ ."}

We will proceed with two cases:\n\nCase 1: $\\angle ABC$ is obtuse. If $\\angle ABC$ is obtuse, then, if we imagine $AB$ as the base of our triangle, the height can be anything in the range $(0,10)$ ; therefore, the area of the triangle will fall in the range of $(0, 20)$ .\n\nCase 2: $\\angle BAC$ is obtuse. Then, if we imagine $AB$ as the base of our triangle, the height can be anything in the range $\\left(0, \\sqrt{10^{2} - 4^{2}}\\right)$ .

If $s \\geq 2 \\sqrt{84}$ , as we just found, $\\angle BAC$ cannot be obtuse, so therefore, there is only one type of triangle - the one in which $\\angle ABC$ is obtuse. Also, if $s > 20$ , no triangle exists with lengths $4$ and $10$ .

The yellow triangle $ABC'$ has the longest side $BC',$ the blue triangle $ABC$ has the longest side $AC.$ If $BC\\perp AB,$ then $BC = \\sqrt {AC^2 – AB^2} = 2 \\sqrt{21}$ the area is equal to $4\\sqrt{21}.$ In the interval, the blue triangle $ABC$ is acute-angled, the yellow triangle $ABC'$ is obtuse-angled. Their heights and areas are equal. The condition is met.\n\nIf the area is less than $4\\sqrt{21},$ both triangles are obtuse, not equal, so the condition is not met.\n\nTherefore, $s$ is in the range $\\left[ 4 \\sqrt{21}, 20\\right)$ , so answer is $\\left(4 \\sqrt{21}\\right)^{2} + 20^{2} = \\boxed{736}$\n\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss\n\nSolution 8:\nIf $4$ and $10$ are the shortest sides and $\\angle C$ is the included angle, then the area is \\[\\frac{4\\cdot10\\cdot\\sin\\angle C}{2} = 20\\sin\\angle C.\\] Because $0\\leq\\sin\\angle C\\leq1$ , the maximum value of $20\\sin\\angle C$ is $20$ , so $s\\leq20$ .\n\nIf $4$ is a shortest side and $10$ is the longest side, the length of the other short side is $4\\cos\\angle C+2\\sqrt{4\\cos^2 \\angle C+21}$ by law of cosines, and the area is $2\\left(4\\cos\\angle C+2\\sqrt{4\\cos^2\\angle C+21}\\right)\\sqrt{1-\\cos\\angle C}$ .

We factor equation 3 like so: \\[abc+d(ab+bc+ca)=14\\] Then we plug in equation 2 to receive $abc-4d=14$ . By equation 4 we get $abc=\\frac{30}{d}$ . Plugging in, we get $\\frac{30}{d}-4d=14$ . Multiply by $d$ on both sides to get the quadratic equation $4d^2+14d-30=0$ . Solving using the quadratic equation, we receive $d=\\frac{3}{2},d=-5$ . So, we have to test which one is correct. We repeat a similar process as we did above for equations 1 and 2. We factor equation 2 to get \\[ab+c(a+b)=-4\\] After plugging in equation 1, we get $ab-3c=-4$ . Now we convert it into a quadratic to receive $3c^2-4c-abc=0$ . The value of $abc$ will depend on $d$ . So we obtain the discriminant $16+12abc$ .\nLet d = -5.\nThen $abc = \\frac{30}{-5}$ , so $abc=-6$ , discriminant is $16-72$ , which makes this a dead end. Thus $d=\\frac{3}{2}$ For $d=\\frac{3}{2}$ , making $abc=20$ . This means the discriminant is just $256$ , so we obtain two values for $c$ as well. We get either $c=\\frac{10}{3}$ or $c=-2$ . So, we must AGAIN test which one is correct.\nWe know $ab=3c-4$ , and $a+b=-3$ , so we use these values for testing.\nLet $c=\\frac{10}{3}$ .\nThen $ab=6$ , so $a=\\frac{6}{b}$ . We thus get $\\frac{6}{b}+b=-3$ , which leads to the quadratic $b^2+3b+6$ . The discriminant for this is $9-24$ . That means this value of $c$ is wrong, so $c=-2$ . Thus we get polynomial $b^2+3b-10$ . The discriminant this time is $49$ , so we get two values for $b$ . Through simple inspection, you may see they are interchangeable, as if you take the value $b=2$ , you get $a=-5$ . If you take the value $b=-5$ , you get $a=2$ . So it doesn't matter. That means the sum of all their squares is \\[\\frac{9}{4}+4+4+25=\\frac{141}{4},\\] so the answer is $141+4=\\boxed{145}.$\n\n~amcrunner\n\nSolution 5:\nLet the four equations from top to bottom be listed $(1)$ through $(4)$ respectively. Multiplying both sides of $(3)$ by $d$ and factoring some terms gives us $abcd + d^2(ab + ac + bc) = 14d$ . Substituting using equations $(4)$ and $(2)$ gives us $30 -4 d^2 = 14d$ , and solving gives us $d = -5$ or $d = \\frac{3}{2}$ . Plugging this back into $(3)$ gives us $abc + d(ab + ac + bc) = abc + (-5)(-4) = abc + 20 = 14$ , or using the other solution for $d$ gives us $abc - 6 = 14$ . Solving both of these equations gives us $abc = -6$ when $d = -5$ and $abc = 20$ when $d = \\frac{3}{2}$ .\n\nMultiplying both sides of $(2)$ by $c$ and factoring some terms gives us $abc + c^2 (a + b) = abc -3c^2 = -4c$ . Testing $abc = -6$ will give us an imaginary solution for $c$ , so therefore $abc = 20$ and $d = \\frac{3}{2}$ . This gets us $20 - 3c^2 = -4c$ . Solving for $c$ gives us $c = \\frac{3}{10}$ or $c = -2$ . With a bit of testing, we can see that the correct value of $c$ is $c=-2$ . Now we know $a+b = -3$ and $ab + bc + ca = ab + c(a+b) = ab + 6 = -4$ , $ab = -10$ , and it is obvious that $a = -5$ and $b = 2$ or the other way around, and therefore, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 25 + 4 + 4 + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{141}{4}$ , giving us the answer $141 + 4 = \\boxed{145}$ .\n\n~hihitherethere minor edit by ~Gustyrustypro"}

Define $p_i$ to be the probability that after $i$ moves, the ant ends up on the level it started on.\n\nOn the first move, the ant can stay on the bottom level with $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance and $7$ moves left. Or, it can move to the top level with $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance and $6$ moves left (it has to spend another on the top as it can not return immediately). So the requested probability is $P = \\frac{2}{3}(1 - p_7) + \\frac{1}{3}p_6$ .\n\nConsider when the ant has $i$ moves left (and it's not the ant's first move). It can either stay on its current level with $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance and $i - 1$ moves left, or travel to the opposite level with $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance, then move to another vertex on the opposite level, to have $i - 2$ moves left. Thus we obtain the recurrence \\[p_i = \\frac{1}{2}p_{i - 1} + \\frac{1}{2}(1 - p_{i - 2})\\]\n\nComputing $p_i$ with the starting conditions $p_0 = 1$ and $p_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ , we obtain $p_6 = \\frac{33}{64}$ and $p_7 = \\frac{59}{128}$ . Hence $P = \\frac{2}{3}(1 - p_7) + \\frac{1}{3}p_6= \\frac{17}{32}$ as desired; $\\boxed{049}$ .\n\n~polarity\n\nSolution 4 (Casework):\nOn each move, we can either stay on the level we previously were (stay on the bottom/top) or switch levels (go from top to bottom and vise versa). Since we start on the bottom, ending on the top means that we will have to switch an odd number of times; since we cannot switch twice in a row, over an eight-move period we can either make one or three switches. Furthermore, once we switch to a level we can choose one of two directions of traveling on that level: clockwise or counterclockwise (since we can't go back to our previous move, our first move on the level after switching determines our direction).\n\nCase 1: one switch. Our one switch can either happen at the start/end of our moves, or in the middle. There are $4 + 24 = 28$ ways to do this, outlined below. Subcase 1: switch happens at ends. If our first move is a switch, then there are two ways to determine the direction we travel along the top layer. Multiply by $2$ to count for symmetry (last move is a switch) so this case yields $2^2 = 4$ possibilities. Subcase 2: switch happens in the middle. There are six places for the switch to happen; the switch breaks the sequences of moves into two chains, with each having $2$ ways to choose their direction of travel. This case yields $6 \\cdot 2^2 = 24$ possibilities. Case 2: three switches. Either two, one, or none of our switches occur at the start/end of our moves. There are $16 + 96 + 64 = 176$ ways to do this, outlined below. (Keep in mind we can't have two switches in a row.) Subcase 1: start and end with a switch. Since our third switch can't be in moves $2$ or $7$ , there are four ways to place our switch, breaking our sequence into two chains. This case yields $4 \\cdot 2^2 = 16$ possibilities. Subcase 2: one of our switches is at the start/end. WLOG our first move is a switch; moves $2$ and $8$ cannot be switches. We can choose $2$ from any of the remaining $5$ moves to be switches, but we have to subtract the $4$ illegal cases where the two switches are in a row (3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7). These three switches break our sequence into three chains; accounting for symmetry this case yields $2\\left(\\binom{5}{2} - 4\\right) \\cdot 2^3 = 96$ possibilities. Subcase 3: all our switches are in the middle. We choose $3$ from any of the $6$ middle moves to be our switches, but have to subtract the cases where at least two of them are in a row. If at least two switches are in a row, there are five places for the group of $2$ and four places for the third switch; however this overcounts the case where all three are in a row, which has $4$ possibilities. These three switches break our sequence into four chains, so this case yields $\\left(\\binom{6}{3} - 5 \\cdot 4 + 4\\right) \\cdot 2^4 = 64$ possibilities.\n\nOur probability is then $\\frac{176 + 28}{3 \\cdot 2^7} = \\frac{17}{32}$ , so the answer is $17+32=\\boxed{049}$ .\n\nSolution 5 (One-Variable Recursion and Casework):\nLet $p(n)$ be the probability that we are on the top when you get to the $n$ th move, and $p(n-1)$ and $p(n-2)$ be the probability that you are on the top when you get to the $(n-1)$ th move and $(n-2)$ th move respectively.\n\nNow you can do some recursion, splitting up into cases:\n\nCase 1: You are not on the top for the $(n-1)$ th move or the $(n-2)$ th move. In this case, it is a $1-p(n-1)$ chance that you were not on the top for the $(n-1)$ th move, and a $1-p(n-2)$ that you are not on the top for the $(n-2)$ th move. This leads you to a $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot(1-p(n-1))\\cdot(1-p(n-2))$ chance for the first case. (The $\\frac12$ is there because of the fact that you can go up and you can also stay on the bottom side, as you cannot return.)\n\nCase 2: You are on the top for the $(n-1)$ th move, but not on the top for the $(n-2)$ th move. This leads you to a $p(n-1)\\cdot(1-p(n-2))$ probability (no extra components because you cannot return).\n\nCase 3: You are on top for both the $(n-1)$ th move and the $(n-2)$ th move. This leads to a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot p(n-1)\\cdot p(n-2)$ (adding the extra $\\frac12$ because you can either stay on the top or go down.\n\nAs the 4th case requires you to go down then up, but you cannot retrace, there is no $4$ th case.\n\nThese cases, added up, lead you to \\[p(n)=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot(1-p(n-1))(1-p(n-2))+p(n-1)(1-p(n-2))+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot p(n-1)p(n-2).\\] This can be further simplified down by expanding and combining like terms to \\[p(n)=\\frac{1+p(n-1)-p(n-2)}{2}.\\] Then we must find $p(1)$ and $p(2)$ . p(1) is trivially $\\frac{1}{3}$ . You can find $p(2)$ using basic probability techniques that is left as an exercise to the reader to get $\\frac{2}{3}$ . In the end, you plug in to get \\[p(1)=\\frac{1}{3}, P(2)=\\frac{2}{3}, P(3)=\\frac{2}{3}, P(4)=\\frac{1}{2}, P(5)=\\frac{5}{12}, P(6)=\\frac{11}{24}, P(7)=\\frac{25}{48}, P(8)=\\boxed{\\frac{17}{32}}.\\] Therefore, the answer is $17+32=\\boxed{049}$ .\n\n~dragoon"}

For example, if $S=\\{47,48,49,50\\},$ then all students will know that no one gets $46$ or $51,$ otherwise that student will reply yes (as discussed). Therefore, all students will conclude that $S$ has only one possibility.\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSolution 2:\nWe know right away that $42\\not\\in S$ and $84\\not\\in S$ as stated in Solution 1.\n\nTo get a feel for the problem, let’s write out some possible values of $S$ based on the teacher’s remarks. The first multiple of 7 that is two-digit is 14. The closest multiple of six from 14 is 12, and therefore there are two possible sets of four consecutive integers containing 12 and 14; $\\{11,12,13,14\\}$ and $\\{12,13,14,15\\}$ . Here we get our first crucial idea; that if the multiples of 6 and 7 differ by two, there will be 2 possible sets of $S$ without any student input. Similarly, if they differ by 3, there will be only 1 possible set, and if they differ by 1, 3 possible sets.\n\nNow we read the student input. Each student says they can’t figure out what $S$ is just based on the teacher’s information, which means each student has to have a number that would be in 2 or 3 of the possible sets (This is based off of the first line of student input). However, now that each student knows that all of them have numbers that fit into more than one possible set, this means that S cannot have two possible sets because otherwise, when shifting from one set to the other, one of the end numbers would not be in the shifted set, but we know each number has to fall in two or more possible sets. For example, take $\\{11,12,13,14\\}$ and $\\{12,13,14,15\\}$ . The numbers at the end, 11 and 15, only fall in one set, but each number must fall in at least two sets. This means that there must be three possible sets of S, in which case the actual S would be the middle S.\nTake for example $\\{33,34,35,36\\}$ , $\\{34,35,36,37\\}$ , and $\\{35,36,37,38\\}$ . 37 and 34 fall in two sets while 35 and 36 fall in all three sets, so the condition is met. Now, this means that the multiple of 6 and 7 must differ by 1.\nSince 42 means the difference is 0, when you add/subtract 6 and 7, you will obtain the desired difference of 1, and similarly adding/subtracting 6 or 7 from 84 will also obtain the difference of 1. Thus there are four possible sets of $S$ ; $\\{34,35,36,37\\}$ , $\\{47,48,49,50\\}$ , $\\{76,77,78,79\\}$ and $\\{89,90,91,92.\\}$ . Therefore the sum of the greatest elements of the possible sets $S$ is $37+50+79+92=\\boxed{258}$\n\n~KingRavi\n\nSolution 3:\nIn a solution that satisfies these constraints, the multiple of 6 must be adjacent to multiple of 7. The other two numbers must be on either side.\n\nWLOG assume the set is $\\{a,6j,7k,b\\}$ . The student with numbers $a$ , $6j$ , and $7k$ can think the set is $\\{a-1, a,6j,7k\\}$ or $\\{a,6j,7k,b\\}$ , and the students with number $6j$ , $7k$ , and $b$ can think the set is $\\{a,6j,7k,b\\}$ or $\\{6j,7k,b, b+1\\}$ . Therefore, none of the students know the set for sure.\n\nPlaying around with the arrangement of the multiple of 6 and multiple of 7 shows that this is the only configuration viewed as ambiguous to all the students. (Therefore when they hear nobody else knows either, they can find out it is this configuration)\n\nConsidering $S$ as $\\{a,6j,7k,b\\}$ ,b is 2 mod 6 and 1 mod 7, so $b$ is 8 mod 42. (since it is all 2-digit, the values are either 50 or 92).\n\nSimilarly, considering $S$ as $\\{a,7j,6k,b\\}$ , $b$ is 1 mod 6 and 2 mod 7, so $b$ is 37 mod 42. The values that satisfy that are 37 and 79.\n\nThe total sum of all these values is therefore $50+92+37+79=\\boxed{258}$ .\n\nThis solution will even work when the bounds (in this question, 2-digit so <100) are much larger and it is impractical to perform casework.\n\n~balav123\n\nSolution 4 (Logic):\nConsider the tuple $(a, a+1, a+2, a+3)$ as a possible $S$ . If one of the values in $S$ is $3$ or $4 \\pmod{7}$ , observe the student will be able to deduce $S$ with no additional information. This is because, if a value is $b = 3 \\pmod{7}$ and $S$ contains a $0 \\pmod{7}$ , then the values of $S$ must be $(b-3, b-2, b-1, b)$ . Similarly, if we are given a $b \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$ and we know that $0 \\pmod{7}$ is in $S$ , $S$ must be $(b, b+1, b+2, b+3).$ Hence, the only possibility for $a$ is $5, 6 \\pmod{7}.$\n\nIn either case, we are guaranteed there is a $6, 0, 1 \\pmod{7}$ value in $7$ . The difference comes down to if there is a $5 \\pmod{7}$ value or a $1 \\pmod{7}$ value. The person receiving such value will be able to determine all of $S$ but the $6, 0, 1 \\pmod{7}$ people will not be able to differentiate the two cases ... yet.\n\nNow consider which value among the consecutive integers is $c \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}$ , if any. The person will know that $S$ is either $(c-3, c-2, c-1, c)$ or $(c, c+1, c+2, c+3)$ to have a $0 \\pmod{6}$ value in $S$ . Neither the $6, 1 \\pmod{7}$ person can be $3 \\pmod{7}$ , else they can decipher what $S$ is right off the bat by considering which set has $0 \\pmod{7}.$ This translates to the possible $5 \\pmod{7}$ or $1 \\pmod{7}$ person cannot be $0 \\pmod{6}$ . We are given that $0 \\pmod{7}$ and $0 \\pmod{6}$ cannot be the same person. Hence we conclude one of the $6 \\pmod{7}$ or $1 \\pmod{7}$ must be the $0 \\pmod{6}$ person.\n\nLet the $6 \\pmod{7}$ person be $0 \\pmod{6}.$ Then--hypothetical-- $c \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ person is $3 \\pmod{6}.$ After the first round, the $6, 0, 1 \\pmod{7}$ people realize that $2 \\pmod{7}$ is not in $S$ else they would have deduced $S$ by noting $S$ was either $(c-3, c-2, c-1, c)$ or $(c, c+1, c+2, c+3)$ to have a $0 \\pmod{6}$ and choosing the former based on where $0 \\pmod{7}$ is. Hence they figure out $S$ by knowing $5 \\pmod{7}.$ So $a \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$ and $a \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$ (from $6 \\pmod{7}$ person being $0 \\pmod{6}$ ).\n\nSimilarly, if $1 \\pmod{7}$ person is $0 \\pmod{6}$ we find that $a \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$ (so a $2 \\pmod{7}$ is in $S$ ) and $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod{6}.$\n\nBy CRT, the possibilities are $a \\equiv 5,  34 \\pmod{42}.$ The sum of the greatest values of $S$ are the sum of $a + 3$ and so we get $(34 + 3) + (47 + 3) + (76 + 3) + (89 + 3) = \\boxed{258}.$\n\n~Aaryabhatta1\n\nSolution 5 (THINK):\nStart by writing down every two-digit multiple of $6$ and $7$ . First, $42$ and $84$ will not be in $S$ because we need two distinct numbers where one is a multiple of $6$ and ANOTHER is a multiple of $7$ . Furthermore, it is clear at this point that if the multiples of $6$ and $7$ are exactly $3$ apart, then it will be obvious what $S$ is; it is just the smaller multiple to the larger multiple. Therefore, we cross out numbers $18, 21, 24, 60, 63, 66$ .\n\nThat leaves us with pairs of multiples of $6$ and $7$ that are exactly $1$ or $2$ apart. In this case, if the multiples of $6$ and $7$ are two apart, such as $12$ and $14$ , then the non-multiples will be able to deduce what the set is; this leaves that the $6$ and $7$ must be one apart.\n\nSpecifically, these are pairs $(35, 36), (48, 49), (77, 78),$ and $(90, 91)$ . In each of these pairs, respectively, the largest number will be one greater than the larger multiple, namely $37, 50, 79, 92$ . Therefore, our answer is $37 + 50 + 79 + 92 = \\boxed{258}$ .\n\n~ xHypotenuse"}

We can express this area using the areas of triangles $AXB$ , $BXC$ , $CXD$ , and $DXA$ . Since we want to find $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$ , we can represent these areas using $\\sin \\theta$ as follows: \\begin{align*} 30 &=[ABCD] \\\\ &=[AXB] + [BXC] + [CXD] + [DXA] \\\\ &=\\frac{1}{2} ab \\sin (\\angle AXB) + \\frac{1}{2} bc \\sin (\\angle BXC) + \\frac{1}{2} cd \\sin (\\angle CXD) + \\frac{1}{2} da \\sin (\\angle AXD) \\\\ &=\\frac{1}{2} ab \\sin (180^\\circ - \\theta) + \\frac{1}{2} bc \\sin (\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2} cd \\sin (180^\\circ - \\theta) + \\frac{1}{2} da \\sin (\\theta). \\end{align*} We know that $\\sin (180^\\circ - \\theta) = \\sin \\theta$ . Therefore it follows that: \\begin{align*} 30 &=\\frac{1}{2} ab \\sin (180^\\circ - \\theta) + \\frac{1}{2} bc \\sin (\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2} cd \\sin (180^\\circ - \\theta) + \\frac{1}{2} da \\sin (\\theta) \\\\ &=\\frac{1}{2} ab \\sin (\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2} bc \\sin (\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2} cd \\sin (\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2} da \\sin (\\theta) \\\\ &=\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\theta (ab + bc + cd + da). \\end{align*} From here we see that $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{60}{ab + bc + cd + da}$ . Now we need to find $\\cos \\theta$ . Using the Law of Cosines on each of the four smaller triangles, we get following equations: \\begin{align*}   5^2 &= a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos(180^\\circ-\\theta), \\\\   6^2 &= b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos \\theta, \\\\   9^2 &= c^2 + d^2 - 2cd\\cos(180^\\circ-\\theta), \\\\   7^2 &= d^2 + a^2 - 2da\\cos \\theta.   \\end{align*} We know that $\\cos (180^\\circ - \\theta) = -\\cos \\theta$ for all $\\theta$ . We can substitute this value into our equations to get: \\begin{align*}   5^2 &= a^2 + b^2 + 2ab\\cos \\theta, &&(1) \\\\   6^2 &= b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos \\theta, &&(2) \\\\   9^2 &= c^2 + d^2 + 2cd\\cos \\theta, &&(3) \\\\   7^2 &= d^2 + a^2 - 2da\\cos \\theta. &&(4) \\end{align*} If we subtract $(2)+(4)$ from $(1)+(3)$ , the squared terms cancel, leaving us with: \\begin{align*} 5^2 + 9^2 - 6^2 - 7^2 &= 2ab \\cos \\theta + 2bc \\cos \\theta + 2cd \\cos \\theta + 2da \\cos \\theta \\\\  21 &= 2\\cos \\theta (ab  + bc + cd + da). \\end{align*} From here we see that $\\cos \\theta = \\frac{21/2}{ab + bc + cd + da}$ .\n\nSince we have figured out $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$ , we can calculate $\\tan \\theta$ : \\[\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta} = \\frac{\\frac{60}{ab + bc + cd + da}}{\\frac{21/2}{ab + bc + cd + da}} = \\frac{60}{21/2} = \\frac{120}{21} = \\frac{40}{7}.\\] Therefore our answer is $40 + 7 = \\boxed{047}$ .\n\n~ Steven Chen (www.professorchenedu.com)\n\n~ my_aops_lessons\n\nSolution 2 (Right Triangles):\nIn convex quadrilateral $ABCD,$ let $AB=5,BC=6,CD=9,$ and $DA=7.$ Let $A'$ and $C'$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $A$ and $C,$ respectively, to $\\overline{BD}.$ We obtain the following diagram: [asy] /* Made by MRENTHUSIASM */ size(500);  pair A, B, C, D, P, A1, C1; B = origin; D = (3*sqrt(32498*(29400*sqrt(47)+312523))/32498,0); A = intersectionpoints(Circle(B,5),Circle(D,7))[0]; C = intersectionpoints(Circle(B,6),Circle(D,9))[1]; P = intersectionpoint(A--C,B--D); A1 = foot(A,B,D); C1 = foot(C,B,D); markscalefactor=3/160; draw(rightanglemark(A,A1,D),red); draw(rightanglemark(C,C1,B),red); dot(\"$A$\",A,1.5*dir(aCos(7/sqrt(1649)))); dot(\"$B$\",B,1.5*W); dot(\"$C$\",C,1.5*dir(180+aCos(7/sqrt(1649)))); dot(\"$D$\",D,1.5*E); dot(\"$E$\",P,dir(180-(180-aCos(7/sqrt(1649)))/2)); dot(\"$A'$\",A1,dir(-75)); dot(\"$C'$\",C1,N); label(\"$\\theta$\",P,dir(180+aCos(7/sqrt(1649))/2),red); draw(A--A1^^C--C1,dashed); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle^^A--C^^B--D); [/asy] Let $BC'=p,C'E=q,EA'=r,A'D=s,AA'=h_1,$ and $CC'=h_2.$ We apply the Pythagorean Theorem to right triangles $\\triangle ABA',\\triangle BCC',\\triangle CDC',$ and $\\triangle DAA',$ respectively: \\[\\begin{array}{ccccccccccccccccc} (p+q+r)^2&+&h_1^2&=&5^2, &&&&&&&&&&&&\\hspace{36mm}(1) \\\\ [1ex] p^2&+&h_2^2&=&6^2, &&&&&&&&&&&&\\hspace{36mm}(2) \\\\ [1ex] (q+r+s)^2&+&h_2^2&=&9^2, &&&&&&&&&&&&\\hspace{36mm}(3) \\\\ [1ex] s^2&+&h_1^2&=&7^2. &&&&&&&&&&&&\\hspace{36mm}(4) \\end{array}\\] Let the brackets denote areas.

It should be fairly obvious that $n \\geq 3$ ; so we may break up the initial condition into two sub-conditions.\n\n(1) $5^n \\equiv n \\pmod{8}$ . Notice that the square of any odd integer is $1$ modulo $8$ (proof by plugging in $1^2,3^2,5^2,7^2$ into modulo $8$ ), so the LHS of this expression goes $5,1,5,1,\\ldots$ , while the RHS goes $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,\\ldots$ . The cycle length of the LHS is $2$ , RHS is $8$ , so the cycle length of the solution is $\\operatorname{lcm}(2,8)=8$ . Indeed, the $n$ that solve this congruence are exactly those such that $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$ .\n\n(2) $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{125}$ . This is extremely computationally intensive if we try to calculate all $2^1,2^2,\\ldots,2^{100} \\pmod{125}$ , so we take a divide-and-conquer approach instead. In order for this expression to be true, $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{5}$ is necessary; it shouldn't take too long for us to go through the $20$ possible LHS-RHS combinations, considering that $n$ must be odd. We only need to test $10$ values of $n$ and obtain $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{20}$ or $n \\equiv 17 \\pmod{20}$ .\n\nWith this in mind we consider $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{25}$ . By the Generalized Fermat's Little Theorem, $2^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ , but we already have $n$ modulo $20$ . Our calculation is greatly simplified. The LHS's cycle length is $20$ and the RHS's cycle length is $25$ , from which their least common multiple is $100$ . In this step we need to test all the numbers between $1$ to $100$ that $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{20}$ or $n \\equiv 17 \\pmod{20}$ . In the case that $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{20}$ , the RHS goes $3,23,43,63,83$ , and we need $2^n \\equiv n \\equiv 2^3 \\pmod{25}$ ; clearly $n \\equiv 83 \\pmod{100}$ . In the case that $n \\equiv 17 \\pmod{20}$ , by a similar argument, $n \\equiv 97 \\pmod{100}$ .\n\nIn the final step, we need to calculate $2^{97}$ and $2^{83}$ modulo $125$ :\n\nNote that $2^{97}\\equiv2^{-3}$ ; because $8\\cdot47=376\\equiv1\\pmod{125},$ we get $2^{97} \\equiv 47\\pmod{125}$ .\n\nNote that $2^{83}$ is $2^{-17}=2^{-16}\\cdot2^{-1}$ .

It should be $n \\equiv 283,297 \\pmod{500}$ .\n\nPut everything together. By the second subcondition, the only candidates less than $1000$ are $283,297,783,797$ .

It is easy to check $n < 3$ don't work, so we have that $n \\geq 3$ . Then, $2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$ and $5^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}$ , so we just have $5^n \\equiv n \\pmod{8}$ and $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{125}$ . Let us consider both of these congruences separately.\n\nFirst, we look at $5^n \\equiv n \\pmod{8}$ . By Euler's Totient Theorem (ETT), we have $5^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ , so $5^5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$ . On the RHS of the congruence, the possible values of $n$ are all nonnegative integers less than $8$ and on the RHS the only possible values are $5$ and $1$ . However, for $5^n$ to be $1 \\pmod{8}$ we must have $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$ , a contradiction. So, the only possible values of $n$ are when $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\implies n = 8k+5$ .\n\nNow we look at $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{125}$ . Plugging in $n = 8k+5$ , we get $2^{8k+5} \\equiv 8k+5 \\pmod{125} \\implies 2^{8k} \\cdot 32 \\equiv 8k+5 \\pmod{125}$ . Note, for $2^n \\equiv n\\pmod{125}$ to be satisfied, we must have $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{5}$ and $2^n \\equiv n\\pmod{25}$ . Since $2^{8k} \\equiv 1\\pmod{5}$ as $8k \\equiv 0\\pmod{4}$ , we have $2 \\equiv -2k \\pmod{5} \\implies k = 5m-1$ . Then, $n = 8(5m-1) + 5 = 40m-3$ . Now, we get $2^{40m-3} \\equiv 40m-3 \\pmod{125}$ . Using the fact that $2^n \\equiv n\\pmod{25}$ , we get $2^{-3} \\equiv 15m-3 \\pmod{25}$ . The inverse of $2$ modulo $25$ is obviously $13$ , so $2^{-3} \\equiv 13^3 \\equiv 22 \\pmod{25}$ , so $15m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25} \\implies m = 5s$ . Plugging in $m = 5s$ , we get $n = 200s - 3$ .\n\nNow, we are finally ready to plug $n$ into the congruence modulo $125$ . Plugging in, we get $2^{200s-3} \\equiv 200s - 3 \\pmod{125}$ . By ETT, we get $2^{100} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125}$ , so $2^{200s- 3} \\equiv 2^{-3} \\equiv 47 \\pmod{125}$ . Then, $200s \\equiv 50 \\pmod{125} \\implies s \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\implies s = 5y+4$ .

The desired $n$ has the form $n = m + 20l + 100p,$ where $m, l, p$ are integers and $m < 20.$\n\nReally: \\[(2^{m+ 20} – (m + 20)) – (2^m – m) =  (2^{m+ 20} – 2^m) – 20.\\] The first term is a multiple of $100$ ( Claim ).\n\nWe denote step an increase in $m$ by 20.

If the expression $2^n + 5^n – n$ is a multiple of $1000,$ the number $n$ is odd ( $2^n$ is even, $5^n$ is odd), which means that $5^n$ ends in $125.$ Therefore, the number $2^n – n$ ends in $875.$\n\n3. $2^3 – 3 = 8 – 3 = 5.$ The tens digit is even $(0),$ it cannot be transformed into $7$ in several steps, since at each step this digit changes by $2.$\n\n$17 = 20 – 3,$ so $2^{17} + 2^3$ is a multiple of $10,$ $(2^{17} – 17) + (2^3 – 3) = 2^{17} + 2^3 – 20$ is a multiple of $10.$ \\[2^{17} \\pmod {100} = ((2^{10} \\pmod {100}) \\cdot (2^7 \\pmod {100})) \\pmod {100} = (24 \\cdot 28) \\pmod {100} = 72.\\] \\[(2^{17} – 17 ) \\pmod {100}  = 55.\\] The tens digit $5$ is odd, subtracting $2$ at each step in $4$ steps of $20$ will turn it into $7.$ So \\[(2^{97} – 97 ) \\pmod {100} = 75.\\] \\[2^{97} \\pmod {1000} =  ((2^{49} \\pmod {1000}) \\cdot 2^7) \\pmod {1000} =  672.\\] \\[(2^{97} – 97 ) \\pmod {1000} = 575.\\] We transform $5$ into $8$ in $7$ STEPS , so \\[(2^{797} – 797 ) \\pmod {1000} = 875.\\] \\[(5^{797} + 2^{797} – 797 ) \\pmod {1000} = 0.\\] Note, that for $n = 797 + 1000k, k$ is an integer, the expression $2^n + 5^n – n$ is a multiple of $1000.$\n\nClaim\n\nThe numbers $2^{n+2\\cdot 5^k}+2^n=2^n(2^{2\\cdot 5^k}+1)$ and $2^{n+4\\cdot 5^k}-2^n=2^n(2^{4\\cdot 5^k}-1)$\n\nare a multiple of $10^{k+1}$ for any $n > k$ , where $n,k$ are an integer.\n\nProof\n\nFirst, if $m \\pmod{10} \\equiv 4,$ then $(m^4 – m^3 + m^2 – m + 1) \\pmod{10} \\equiv 6 – 4 + 6 – 4 + 1 = 5.$\n\n$2^{4n+2}\\pmod{10} \\equiv 4.$ So, if the number $2^{4n+2}  + 1$ is a multiple of $5^k$ , then $2^{20n+10} + 1$ is a multiple of $5^{k +1}.$\n\nReally, denote $m =  2^{4n+2},$ then, $2^{20n+10} + 1 =  m^5 + 1 = (m + 1)\\cdot (m^4 – m^3 + m^2 – m + 1).$\n\nThe first factor is a multiple of $5^k$ , the second factor is a multiple of $5.$ Their product is a multiple of $5^{k +1}.$\n\nFor odd $n,$ using Newton's binomial for $4^n$ , we get $2^{2n} + 1$ is a multiple of $5.$ \\begin{align*} 2^{2n} + 1 = 4^n + 1 = (5 - 1)^n + 1 = 5^n -n\\cdot 5^{n-1} +...+5n\\end{align*} If $n = 5^k,$ then $n > k,$ each term is  a multiple of $5n$ .\n\nTherefore, the number $4^{5^k}+1$ is  a multiple of $5^{k+1}$ and $2^{k+1} (2^{2\\cdot 5^k}+1)$ is  a multiple of $10^{k+1}$ .\n\nThe difference \\[2^{n+4\\cdot 5^k}-2^n=2^n(2^{4\\cdot 5^k}-1) = 2^n(2^{2\\cdot 5^k}-1)(2^{2\\cdot 5^k}+1)\\] is a multiple of $10^{k+1}.$\n\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss\n\nSolution 6 (Art of Enumeration):\nProblem require us to find minimum $n$ where $2^n + 5^n - n$ is a multiple of $1000$ .\n\nSince we already know that multiplication does not affect mod,we can simply just focus on enumerating and hope to find some pattern.\n\nThe pattern of $5^n$ is pretty simple, it starts with 5,25, and then repeat the pattern 125,625, in other words, $5^n\\equiv 125 \\mod{1000}$ when n is odd, and $5^n\\equiv 625 \\mod{1000}$ when n is even if we ignore $n=1$ and $n=2$ .\n\nThe pattern of $2^n$ , however, is quite long. In fact, it happens when $n=103$ , where $2^{103} \\equiv 008 \\mod{1000}$ . More specifically, the pattern starts with $n=3$ , which means for every 100 n, $2^n \\mod 1000$ will repeat in a loop:\n\n$008{,}016{,}032{,}064{,}128{,}256{,}512{,}024{,}048{,}096{,}$ $192{,}384{,}768{,}536{,}072{,}144{,}288{,}576{,}152{,}304{,}$ $608{,}216{,}432{,}864{,}728{,}456{,}912{,}824{,}648{,}296{,}$ $592{,}184{,}368{,}736{,}472{,}944{,}888{,}776{,}552{,}104{,}$ $208{,}416{,}832{,}664{,}328{,}656{,}312{,}624{,}248{,}496{,}$ $992{,}984{,}968{,}936{,}872{,}744{,}488{,}976{,}952{,}904{,}$ $808{,}616{,}232{,}464{,}928{,}856{,}712{,}424{,}848{,}696{,}$ $392{,}784{,}568{,}136{,}272{,}544{,}088{,}176{,}352{,}704{,}$ $408{,}816{,}632{,}264{,}528{,}056{,}112{,}224{,}448{,}896{,}$ $792{,}584{,}168{,}336{,}672{,}344{,}688{,}376{,}752{,}504$\n\nMoreover, we might found that for every 20 consequtive integer, $2^n \\mod 100$ will repeat in a loop. Thus, by adding $5^n$ to first twenty element, which is $n=3$ to $n=22$ , we can get a pattern of last two digit of $2^n + 5^n \\mod{1000}$ , which is\n\n$33{,}41{,}57{,}89{,}53{,}$\n\n$81{,}37{,}49{,}73{,}21{,}$\n\n$17{,}09{,}93{,}61{,}97{,}$\n\n$69{,}13{,}01{,}77{,}29$\n\nBy subtracting n, we can also get following sequence:\n\n$30{,}37{,}52{,}83{,}46{,}$\n\n$73{,}28{,}39{,}62{,}09{,}$\n\n$04{,}95{,}78{,}45{,}80{,}$\n\n$51{,}94{,}81{,}56{,}07$\n\nNoticing that only when $n=3$ and $n=17$ , $2^n+5^n-n \\equiv 0 \\mod{10}$ , so $n=3+20k$ and $17+20k$ are our possible candidates. However, since the length of our pattern is 20, we know that $n=3+20k$ is definetely not answer, which only left us $n=17+20k$ .\n\nNow, we calculate the last three digit of $2^n+5^n-n$ at $n=17, n=37, n=57, n=77, n=97$ , which is $180{,}560{,}940{,}320{,}700$ .\n\nSince the pattern will repeat for every 100 consequtive integer, the only thing that could possibly change last three digit is -n, noticing that only when $n=97$ , $2^n+5^n-n \\equiv 0 \\mod 100$ . So the answer only could be $n=97+100k_2$ , by subtracting 700, which means adding 700 to n, we can get our final answer $n=\\boxed{797}$ .\n\nAlso, by this method we can ensure that $\\frac{2^n+5^n-n}{1000}$ is an integer only if $n=797+1000k$ , all the calculation can be done without a calculator (about 15 minutes or so), need some patience though.\n\nIf you are wondering, $2^{103} = 10{,}141{,}204{,}801{,}825{,}835{,}211{,}973{,}625{,}643{,}008$ .\n\n~henry_in_out"}

If $k^2<n<(k+1)^2$ for (positive) integer k, recursively calculating the value of the function gives us $f(n)=(k+1)^2-n+f((k+1)^2)=k^2+3k+2-n$ . Note that this formula also returns the correct value when $n=(k+1)^2$ , but not when $n=k^2$ . Thus $f(n)=k^2+3k+2-n$ for $k^2<n \\leq (k+1)^2$ .\n\nIf $2 \\mid (k+1)^2-n$ , $g(n)$ returns the same value as $f(n)$ . This is because the recursion once again stops at $(k+1)^2$ . We seek a case in which $f(n)<g(n)$ , so obviously this is not what we want. We want $(k+1)^2,n$ to have a different parity, or $n, k$ have the same parity. When this is the case, $g(n)$ instead returns $(k+2)^2-n+g((k+2)^2)=k^2+5k+6-n$ .\n\nWrite $7f(n)=4g(n)$ , which simplifies to $3k^2+k-10=3n$ . Notice that we want the LHS expression to be divisible by 3; as a result, $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ . We also want n to be strictly greater than $k^2$ , so $k-10>0, k>10$ . The LHS expression is always even (since $3k^2+k-10$ factors to $k(3k+1)-10$ , and one of $k$ and $3k+1$ will be even), so to ensure that $k$ and $n$ share the same parity, $k$ should be even. Then the least $k$ that satisfies these requirements is $k=16$ , giving $n=258$ .\n\nIndeed - if we check our answer, it works.

It follows that $k^2<n<(k+2)^2,$ or \\[n=(k+2)^2-2q\\hspace{38.25mm}(3)\\] for some integer $q$ such that $0<q<2k+2.$ By recursion, we get \\begin{align*} g\\left((k+2)^2\\right)&=k+2, \\\\ g\\left((k+2)^2-2\\right)&=k+4, \\\\ g\\left((k+2)^2-4\\right)&=k+6, \\\\ & \\ \\vdots \\\\ g\\bigl(\\phantom{ }\\underbrace{(k+2)^2-2q}_{n}\\phantom{ }\\bigr)&=k+2q+2. \\hspace{15.5mm}(4) \\\\ \\end{align*} Answer By $(2)$ and $(4),$ we have \\[\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}=\\frac{k+p+1}{k+2q+2}=\\frac{4}{7}. \\hspace{27mm}(5)\\] From $(1)$ and $(3),$ equating the expressions for $n$ gives $(k+1)^2-p=(k+2)^2-2q.$ Solving for $k$ produces \\[k=\\frac{2q-p-3}{2}. \\hspace{41.25mm}(6)\\] We substitute $(6)$ into $(5),$ then simplify, cross-multiply, and rearrange: \\begin{align*} \\frac{\\tfrac{2q-p-3}{2}+p+1}{\\tfrac{2q-p-3}{2}+2q+2}&=\\frac{4}{7} \\\\ \\frac{p+2q-1}{-p+6q+1}&=\\frac{4}{7} \\\\ 7p+14q-7&=-4p+24q+4 \\\\ 11p-11&=10q \\\\ 11(p-1)&=10q. \\hspace{29mm}(7) \\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(11,10)=1,$ we know that $p-1$ must be divisible by $10,$ and $q$ must be divisible by $11.$ Recall that the restrictions on $(1)$ and $(2)$ are $0\\leq p<2k+1$ and $0<q<2k+2,$ respectively. Substituting $(6)$ into either inequality gives $p+1<q.$ Combining all these results produces \\[0<p+1<q<2k+2. \\hspace{28mm}(8)\\] To minimize $n$ in either $(1)$ or $(3),$ we minimize $k,$ so we minimize $p$ and $q$ in $(8).$ From $(6)$ and $(7),$ we construct the following table: \\[\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} & & & \\\\ [-2.5ex] \\boldsymbol{p} & \\boldsymbol{q} & \\boldsymbol{k} & \\textbf{Satisfies }\\boldsymbol{(8)?} \\\\ [0.5ex] \\hline & & & \\\\ [-2ex] 11 & 11 & 4 & \\\\ 21 & 22 & 10 & \\\\ 31 & 33 & 16 & \\checkmark \\\\ \\geq41 & \\geq44 & \\geq22 & \\checkmark \\\\ \\end{array}\\] Finally, we have $(p,q,k)=(31,33,16).$ Substituting this result into either $(1)$ or $(3)$ generates $n=\\boxed{258}.$ Remark We can verify that \\[\\frac{f(258)}{g(258)}=\\frac{1\\cdot31+f(258+1\\cdot31)}{2\\cdot33+g(258+2\\cdot33)}=\\frac{31+\\overbrace{f(289)}^{17}}{66+\\underbrace{g(324)}_{18}}=\\frac{48}{84}=\\frac47.\\]\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSolution 3:\nSince $n$ isn't a perfect square, let $n=m^2+k$ with $0<k<2m+1$ . If $k$ is odd, then $f(n)=g(n)$ . If $k$ is even, then \\begin{align*} f(n)&=(m+1)^2-(m^2+k)+(m+1)=3m+2-k, \\\\ g(n)&=(m+2)^2-(m^2+k)+(m+2)=5m+6-k, \\end{align*} from which \\begin{align*} 7(3m+2-k)&=4(5m+6-k) \\\\ m&=3k+10. \\end{align*} Since $k$ is even, $m$ is even. Since $k\\neq 0$ , the smallest $k$ is $2$ which produces the smallest $n$ : \\[k=2 \\implies m=16 \\implies n=16^2+2=\\boxed{258}.\\] ~Afo\n\nSolution 4 (Quadratics With Two Variables):\nTo begin, note that if $n$ is a perfect square, $f(n)=g(n)$ , so $f(n)/g(n)=1$ , so we must look at values of $n$ that are not perfect squares (what a surprise). First, let the distance between $n$ and the first perfect square greater than or equal to it be $k$ , making the values of $f(n+k)$ and $g(n+k)$ integers. Using this notation, we see that $f(n)=k+f(n+k)$ , giving us a formula for the numerator of our ratio. However, since the function of $g(n)$ does not add one to the previous inputs in the function until a perfect square is achieved, but adds values of two, we can not achieve the value of $\\sqrt{n+k}$ in $g(n)$ unless $k$ is an even number. However, this is impossible, since if $k$ was an even number, $f(n)=g(n)$ , giving a ratio of one. Thus, $k$ must be an odd number.\n\nThus, since $k$ must be an odd number, regardless of whether $n$ is even or odd, to get an integral value in $g(n)$ , we must get to the next perfect square after $n+k$ . To make matters easier, let $z^2=n+k$ . Thus, in $g(n)$ , we want to achieve $(z+1)^2$ .\n\nExpanding $(z+1)^2$ and substituting in the fact that $z=\\sqrt{n+k}$ yields:\n\n\\[(z+1)^2=z^2+2z+1=n+k+2\\sqrt{n+k}+1\\]\n\nThus, we must add the quantity $k+2z+1$ to $n$ to achieve a integral value in the function $g(n)$ . Thus.\n\n\\[g(n)=(k+2z+1)+\\sqrt{n+k+2\\sqrt{n+k}+1}\\]\n\nHowever, note that the quantity within the square root is just $(z+1)^2$ , and so:\n\n\\[g(n)=k+3z+2\\]\n\nThus, \\[\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}=\\frac{k+z}{k+3z+2}\\]\n\nSince we want this quantity to equal $\\frac{4}{7}$ , we can set the above equation equal to this number and collect all the variables to one side to achieve\n\n\\[3k-5z=8\\]\n\nSubstituting back in that $z=\\sqrt{n+k}$ , and then separating variables and squaring yields that\n\n\\[9k^2-73k+64=25n\\]\n\nNow, if we treat $n$ as a constant, we can use the quadratic formula in respect to $k$ to get an equation for $k$ in terms of $n$ (without all the squares). Doing so yields\n\n\\[\\frac{73\\pm\\sqrt{3025+900n}}{18}=k\\]\n\nNow, since $n$ and $k$ are integers, we want the quantity within the square root to be a perfect square. Note that $55^2=3025$ . Thus, assume that the quantity within the root is equal to the perfect square, $m^2$ . Thus, after using a difference of squares, we have \\[(m-55)(m+55)=900n\\] Since we want $n$ to be an integer, we know that the $LHS$ should be divisible by five, so, let's assume that we should have $m$ divisible by five. If so, the quantity $18k-73$ must be divisible by five, meaning that $k$ leaves a remainder of one when divided by 5 (if the reader knows LaTeX well enough to write this as a modulo argument, please go ahead and do so!).\n\nThus, we see that to achieve integers $n$ and $k$ that could potentially satisfy the problem statement, we must try the values of $k$ congruent to one modulo five. However, if we recall a statement made earlier in the solution, we see that we can skip all even values of $k$ produced by this modulo argument.\n\nAlso, note that $k=1,6$ won't work, as they are too small, and will give an erroneous value for $n$ . After trying $k=11,21,31$ , we see that $k=31$ will give a value of $m=485$ , which yields $n=\\boxed{258}$ , which, if plugged in to for our equations of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ , will yield the desired ratio, and we're done.\n\nSide Note: If any part of this solution is not rigorous, or too vague, please label it in the margin with \"needs proof\". If you can prove it, please add a lemma to the solution doing so :)\n\n-Azeem H. (mathislife52)\n\nSolution 5 (Basic Substitutions):\nFirst of all, if $n$ is a perfect square, $f(n)=g(n)=\\sqrt{n}$ and their quotient is $1.$ So, for the rest of this solution, assume $n$ is not a perfect square.\n\nLet $a^2$ be the smallest perfect square greater than $n$ and let $b^2$ be the smallest perfect square greater than $n$ with the same parity as $n,$ and note that either $b=a$ or $b=a+1.$ Notice that $(a-1)^2 < n < a^2.$\n\nWith a bit of inspection, it becomes clear that $f(n) = a+(a^2-n)$ and $g(n) = b+(b^2-n).$\n\nIf $a$ and $n$ have the same parity, we get $a=b$ so $f(n) = g(n)$ and their quotient is $1.$ So, for the rest of this solution, we let $a$ and $n$ have opposite parity. We have two cases to consider.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is odd and $a$ is even\n\nHere, we get $a=2k$ for some positive integer $k.$ Then, $b = 2k+1.$ We let $n = a^2-(2m+1)$ for some positive integer $m$ so $f(n) = 2k+2m+1$ and $g(n) = 2k+1+2m+1+4k+1 = 6k+2m+3.$\n\nWe set $\\frac{2k+2m+1}{6k+2m+3}=\\frac{4}{7},$ cross multiply, and rearrange to get $6m-10k=5.$ Since $k$ and $m$ are integers, the LHS will always be even and the RHS will always be odd, and thus, this case yields no solutions.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is even and $a$ is odd\n\nHere, we get $a=2k+1$ for some positive ineger $k.$ Then, $b=2k+2.$ We let $n = a^2-(2m+1)$ for some positive integer $m$ so $f(n)=2k+1+2m+1=2k+2m+2$ and $g(n)=2k+2+2m+1+4k+3 = 6k+2m+6.$\n\nWe set $\\frac{2k+2m+2}{6k+2m+6} = \\frac{4}{7},$ cross multiply, and rearrange to get $5k=3m-5,$ or $k=\\frac{3}{5}m-1.$ Since $k$ and $m$ are integers, $m$ must be a multiple of $5.$ Some possible solutions for $(k,m)$ with the least $k$ and $m$ are $(2,5), (5,10), (8,15),$ and $(11,20).$\n\nWe wish to minimize $k$ since $a=2k+1.$ One thing to keep in mind is the initial assumption $(a-1)^2 < n < a^2.$\n\nThe pair $(2,5)$ gives $a=2(2)+1=5$ and $n=5^2-(2(5)+1)=14.$ But $4^2<14<5^2$ is clearly false, so we discard this case.\n\nThe pair $(5,10)$ gives $a=2(5)+1=11$ and $n=11^2-(2(10)+1)=100,$ which is a perfect square and therefore can be discarded.\n\nThe pair $(8,15)$ gives $a=2(8)+1=17$ and $n=17^2-(2(15)+1)=258,$ which is between $16^2$ and $17^2$ so it is our smallest solution.\n\nSo, $\\boxed{258}$ is the correct answer.\n\n~mc21s\n\nSolution 6 (Short):\nSay the answer is in the form $n^{2}-x$ , then $x$ must be odd or else $f(x) = g(x)$ . Say $y = n^{2}-x$ . $f(y) = x+n$ , $g(y) = 3n+2+x$ . Because $f(y)/g(y)$ = $4$ *(an integer)/ $7$ *(an integer), $f(y)$ is $4$ *(an integer) so $n$ must be odd or else $f(y)$ would be odd. Solving for $x$ in terms of $n$ gives integer $x = (5/3)n+8/3$ which means $n$ is $2$ mod $3$ , because $n$ is also odd, $n$ is $5$ mod $6$ . $x$ must be less than $2n-1$ or else the minimum square above $y$ would be $(n-1)^{2}$ . We set an inequality $(5/3)n+8/3<2n-1 => 5n+8<6n-3 => n>11$ .\nSince $n$ is $5$ mod $6$ , $n = 17$ and $x = 31$ giving $17^{2}-31$ = $\\boxed{258}$ .\n\n~mathophobia\n\n~ $\\LaTeX$ added by Bread10\n\nSolution 7:\nDefine a nonnegative integer $k$ such that $g(n)-f(n)$ = $k$ . Since $\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = \\frac{4}{7},$ $k$ is a positive integer. Now, suppose 3 consecutive integers $a-1$ , $a$ , and $a+1$ , and $(a-1)^2 < n < a^2$ . When $g(n) > f(n)$ , $g(n)$ must have a different parity than $a$ , so that $f(n)$ 's recursive sequence ends on $a^2$ , while $g(n)$ continues to $(a+1)^2$ . If this condition is satisfied, we can figure out the value of $k$ based on $a$ . According to the definitions of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ , $f(n) = a+a^2-n,$ and $g(n) = (a+1)+(a+1)^2-n,$ which gives $k = 2a+2$ . And because of $f(n) + k = g(n)$ , $\\frac{k}{g(n)} = \\frac{3}{7},$ so cross multiplying gives $3g(n) = 14a+14$ . This means that $14a+14$ is divisible by 3, and thus $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ . The final thing left is to find the smallest $a$ such that the corresponding value of $g(n)$ exist. Simple guess and check should give that the smallest value of $a$ is $a = 17$ , which yields an answer of $n = \\boxed{258}$ .\n\n~ Marchk26\n\nSolution 8 (Fast):\nLet $n=k^2-x$ , where $0 \\leq x \\leq 2k-2$ . This means that $f(n)=k+x$ .\nFor $g(x)$ , note that $x$ must be odd, otherwise $f(n)=g(n)$ . This means that $g(n)$ must 'skip' one perfect square (being $k^2$ ), and go to $(k+1)^2$ . This will take $(k+1)^2-k^2+x+k+1=3k+x+2$ . We have $\\frac{k+x}{3k+x+2}=\\frac{4}{7}$ . Cross multiplying and simplifying we get $3x-5k=8$ . Taking $mod 5$ we have $3x=3 \\mod 5$ or $x = 1 \\mod 5$ . Note that the inequality $0 \\leq x \\leq 2k-2$ when $x=5t+1$ and $t \\geq 5$ . Trying out $t=5$ , we get $x=26$ which doesn't work as x is even. Trying out $t=6$ , we get $x=31$ and $k=17$ , which satisfies all conditions, meaning the answer is $17^2-31=\\boxed{258}.$\n\n~E___"}
