Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.", "model": "deepseek-r1:8b", "seed": 42, "temperature": 0.0, "trace": "GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG", "timestamp": 1759638437, "given_answer": "809", "pred_answer": null, "reference_solution": "Solution 1:\nLet's first try some experimentation. Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are $3$ , Alice will take $1$ , Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are $4$ , Alice will just remove all $4$ at once. If there are $5$ , no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are $1$ , $3$ , or $4$ coins left. Bob wins if there are $2$ or $5$ coins left.\n\nAfter some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If there is n is a multiple of $5$ , then Bob will win. The reason for this is the following: Let's say there are a multiple of $5$ coins remaining in the stack. If Alice takes $1$ , Bob will take $4$ , and there will still be a multiple of $5$ . If Alice takes $4$ , Bob will take $1$ , and there will still be a multiple of $5$ . This process will continue until you get $0$ coins left. For example, let's say there are $205$ coins. No matter what Alice does, Bob can simply just do the complement. After each of them make a turn, there will always be a multiple of $5$ left. This will continue until there are $5$ coins left, and Bob will end up winning.\n\nAfter some more experimentation, you'll realize that any number that is congruent to $2$ mod $5$ will also work. This is because Bob can do the same strategy, and when there are $2$ coins left, Alice is forced to take $1$ and Bob takes the final coin. For example, let's say there are $72$ coins. If Alice takes $1$ , Bob will take $4$ . If Alice takes $4$ , Bob will take $1$ . So after they each make a turn, the number will always be equal to $2$ mod $5$ . Eventually, there will be only $2$ coins remaining, and we've established that Alice will simply take $1$ and Bob will take the final coin.\n\nSo we have to find the number of numbers less than or equal to $2024$ that are either congruent to $0$ mod $5$ or $2$ mod $5$ . There are $404$ numbers in the first category: $5, 10, 15, \\dots, 2020$ . For the second category, there are $405$ numbers. $2, 7, 12, 17, \\dots, 2022$ . So the answer is $404 + 405 = \\boxed{809}$\n\n~lprado\n\nSolution 2:\nLet's use winning and losing positions, where $W$ marks a win for Alice.\n\n$1$ coin: $W$\n\n$2$ coins: $L$\n\n$3$ coins: $W$\n\n$4$ coins: $W$\n\n$5$ coins: $L$\n\n$6$ coin: $W$\n\n$7$ coins: $L$\n\n$8$ coins: $W$\n\n$9$ coins: $W$\n\n$10$ coins: $L$\n\n$11$ coin: $W$\n\n$12$ coins: $L$\n\n$13$ coins: $W$\n\n$14$ coins: $W$\n\n$15$ coins: $L$\n\nWe can see that losing positions occur when $n$ is congruent to $0, 2 \\mod{5}$ and winning positions occur otherwise. As $n$ ranges from $1$ to $2020$ , $\\frac{2}{5}$ of these values are losing positions where Bob will win. As $n$ ranges from $2021$ to $2024$ , $2022$ is the only value where Bob will win. Thus, the answer is $2020\\times\\frac{2}{5}+1=\\boxed{809}$\n\n~alexanderruan\n\nSolution 3:\nDenote by $A_i$ and $B_i$ Alice's or Bob's $i$ th moves, respectively.\n\nCase 1: $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ .\n\nBob can always take the strategy that $B_i = 5 - A_i$ .\nThis guarantees him to win.\n\nIn this case, the number of $n$ is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404$ .\n\nCase 2: $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ .\n\nIn this case, consider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 1$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$ .\nThus, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\n\nCase 3: $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$ .\n\nIn this case, consider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 4$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$ .\nThus, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\n\nCase 4: $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ .\n\nBob can always take the strategy that $B_i = 5 - A_i$ .\nTherefore, after the $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor$ th turn, there are two tokens leftover.\nTherefore, Alice must take 1 in the next turn that leaves the last token on the table.\nTherefore, Bob can take the last token to win the game.\nThis guarantees him to win.\n\nIn this case, the number of $n$ is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor +1 = 405$ .\n\nCase 5: $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$ .\n\nConsider Alice's following strategy: $A_1 = 1$ and $A_i = 5 - B_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$ .\nBy doing so, there will finally be 2 tokens on the table and Bob moves first. Because Bob has the only choice of taking 1 token, Alice can take the last token and win the game.\n\nTherefore, in this case, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\n\nPutting all cases together, the answer is $404 + 405 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(809) }}$ .\n\nSolution 4 (Grundy Values):\nSince the game Alice and Bob play is impartial (the only difference between player 1 and player 2 is that player 1 goes first (note that games like chess are not impartial because each player can only move their own pieces)), we can use the Sprague-Grundy Theorem to solve this problem. We will use induction to calculate the Grundy Values for this game.\n\nWe claim that heaps of size congruent to $0,2 \\bmod{5}$ will be in outcome class $\\mathcal{P}$ (win for player 2 = Bob), and heaps of size equivalent to $1,3,4 \\bmod{5}$ will be in outcome class $\\mathcal{N}$ (win for player 1 = Alice).

Bayes' Theorem states that \\[P(A|B)=\\dfrac{P(B|A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n\nin other words, the probability of $A$ given $B$ is equal to the probability of $B$ given $A$ times the probability of $A$ divided by the probability of $B$ . In our case, $A$ represents the probability of winning the grand prize, and $B$ represents the probability of winning a prize. Clearly, $P(B|A)=1$ , since by winning the grand prize you automatically win a prize. Thus, we want to find $\\dfrac{P(A)}{P(B)}$ .\n\nLet us calculate the probability of winning a prize. We do this through casework: how many of Jen's drawn numbers match the lottery's drawn numbers?\n\nTo win a prize, Jen must draw at least $2$ numbers identical to the lottery. Thus, our cases are drawing $2$ , $3$ , or $4$ numbers identical.\n\nLet us first calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $2$ identical numbers to the lottery. Let Jen choose the numbers $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , and $d$ ; we have $\\dbinom42$ ways to choose which $2$ of these $4$ numbers are identical to the lottery. We have now determined $2$ of the $4$ numbers drawn in the lottery; since the other $2$ numbers Jen chose can not be chosen by the lottery, the lottery now has $10-2-2=6$ numbers to choose the last $2$ numbers from. Thus, this case is $\\dbinom62$ , so this case yields $\\dbinom42\\dbinom62=6\\cdot15=90$ possibilities.\n\nNext, let us calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $3$ identical numbers to the lottery. Again, let Jen choose $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , and $d$ . This time, we have $\\dbinom43$ ways to choose the identical numbers and again $6$ numbers left for the lottery to choose from; however, since $3$ of the lottery's numbers have already been determined, the lottery only needs to choose $1$ more number, so this is $\\dbinom61$ . This case yields $\\dbinom43\\dbinom61=4\\cdot6=24$ .\n\nFinally, let us calculate the number of ways to all $4$ numbers matching. There is actually just one way for this to happen.\n\nIn total, we have $90+24+1=115$ ways to win a prize. The lottery has $\\dbinom{10}4=210$ possible combinations to draw, so the probability of winning a prize is $\\dfrac{115}{210}$ . There is actually no need to simplify it or even evaluate $\\dbinom{10}4$ or actually even know that it has to be $\\dbinom{10}4$ ; it suffices to call it $a$ or some other variable, as it will cancel out later. However, let us just go through with this. The probability of winning a prize is $\\dfrac{115}{210}$ . Note that the probability of winning a grand prize is just matching all $4$ numbers, which we already calculated to have $1$ possibility and thus have probability $\\dfrac1{210}$ . Thus, our answer is $\\dfrac{\\frac1{210}}{\\frac{115}{210}}=\\dfrac1{115}$ .

If you go up first, you will end on the side opposite to it (the right side) and if you go right first, you will end up on the top. It can then be observed that if you choose the turning points in the middle $7 \\times 7$ grid, that will automatically determine your start and ending points. For example, in the diagram if you choose the point $(3,2)$ and $(5,3)$ , you must first move three up or two right, determining your first point, and move 5 up or 3 right, determining your final point. Knowing this is helpful because if we first move anywhere horizontally, we have $7$ points on each column to choose from and starting from left to right, we have $6,5,4,3,2,1$ points on that row to choose from. This gives us $7(6)+7(5)+7(4)+7(3)+7(2)+7(1)$ which simplifies to $7\\cdot21$ . The vertical case is symmetrical so we have $7\\cdot21\\cdot2 = \\boxed{294}$\n\n~KEVIN_LIU\n\nSolution 5:\nAs in Solution 1, there are two cases: $RURUR$ or $URURU$ . We will work with the first case and multiply by $2$ at the end. We use stars and bars; we can treat the $R$ s as the stars and the $U$ s as the bars. However, we must also use stars and bars on the $U$ s to see how many different patterns of bars we can create for the reds. We must have $1$ bar in $8$ blacks, so we use stars and bars on the equation \\[x + y = 8\\] . However, each divider must have at least one black in it, so we do the change of variable $x' = x-1$ and $y' = x-1$ . Our equation becomes \\[x' + y' = 6\\] . By stars and bars, this equation has $\\binom{6 + 2 - 1}{1} = 7$ valid solutions. Now, we use stars and bars on the reds. We must distribute two bars amongst the reds, so we apply stars and bars to \\[x + y + z = 8\\] . Since each group must have one red, we again do a change of variables with $x' = x-1$ , $y' = y-1$ , and $z' = z-1$ . We are now working on the equation \\[x' + y' + z' = 5\\] . By stars and bars, this has $\\binom{5 + 3 - 1}{2} = 21$ solutions. The number of valid paths in this case is the number of ways to create the bars times the number of valid arrangements of the stars given fixed bars, which equals $21 \\cdot 7 = 147$ . We must multiply by two to account for both cases, so our final answer is $147 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{294}$ .\n\n~ cxsmi\n\nSolution 6:\nWe note that we either start with $R$ or $U$ and that these cases are symmetric, so we will simply consider the $R$ case and multiply by $2$ at the end. We make the key observation that making a path is the same as choosing two vertical lines and one horizontal line to mark our path; this gives us a unique path. Because we change directions exactly 4 times, we must travel at least 1 unit before turning, and we also must end by traveling at least one unit, so we cannot choose vertical lines that are on the edge of our grid. Similarly, we cannot do that for the horizontal line. Our final answer is simply choosing 2 vertical lines from 7 total, and choosing one horizontal line from 7 total, all multiplied by two. $2 \\cdot \\binom{7}{2} \\cdot \\binom{7}{1} = \\boxed{294}.$\n\n~those who know\n\nSolution 7:\n2024-AIME-I-P6-S7.jpeg\n\nOur path must either go right, up, right, up, and right (RURUR) or up, right, up, right, and up (URURU). We will consider the RURUR case and multiply by 2 since they're symmetrical.\n\nLabel the $x$ -axis from 0 to 8, starting at the origin and ending at the edge. For the first move (right), we can stop at point 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\nLet's consider the choices for the first and third rightward moves. If we stop at point 7 on the first rightward move, when we get to the third move, we will have 0 choices for choosing a point to go right until; no matter what we do, if we stop at point 7 on the first move, the path will never have more than three turns (see diagram). If we stop at point 6, we will have 1 choice for the third move (we can stop going right until one point before the right edge of the grid for the third move and our path will have 4 turns). If we stop at point 5, we can stop going right until one or two points before the right edge of the grid for the third move. As we continue to move down points, the number of choices for the third rightward move increases by 1. This pattern continues until we stop at point 1 on the first move and have 6 choices for the third move. So, for the first and third moves, we have a total of \\[0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = \\frac{6 \\cdot 7}{2} = 21\\] choices.\n\nFor the second move (upward), we always have 7 choices to stop at (the top, one point before the top, two points before the top... 1 point from the bottom), and the fourth move will always have 1 choice, which is the move that reaches the final point.\n\nFinally, we multiply by 2 to account for the URURU case, which gives us a total of $21 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{294}$ paths.\n\n~ grogg007"}

Substituting $a$ in terms of $x$ and $b$ gives us $\\frac{x^2+8bx+16b^2}{9}+b^2=16$ . Combining fractions, multiplying, and rearranging, gives $25b^2+8xb+(x^2-144)=0$ .

Thus, we have $p^2=289$ and we are attempting to lift modulo $17$ to modulo $289$ .\n\nGiven in the problem, it is established that $p^2\\mid m^4 +1$ holds true, so we can guarantee that $m^4\\equiv 1\\pmod{289}$ . Testing for roots $r_0$ modulo $17$ gives us the solutions $r_0= \\pm 2$ , $\\pm 8$ , which satisfy $r_0^4\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ .\n\nNote that we can now use Hensel's Lemma, by defining a function $f(x)=x^4+1$ , giving $f'(x)=4x^3$ . We know firstly that, though $f(r_0)$ for all roots $r_0$ we found is congruent to $0\\pmod{17}$ , this does not hold true for $f'(r_0)$ , so we guarantee that there is one lift by Hensel's Lemma to $289$ that we can perform, defined for root $r_1$ that $r_1 = r_0-\\frac{f(r_0)}{f'(r_0)}\\pmod{p^k}$ . We now break our work into four cases:\n\n$r_0 = 2$ . $f(2)=17$ and $f'(2)=32$ , so $r_1=2-\\frac{17}{32}\\pmod{289}$ , and we need to find the inverse of $32\\equiv 15$ modulo $17$ . By the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that $8\\cdot 15\\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}$ , and thus $r_1=2-17\\cdot 8\\equiv 155 \\pmod{289}$ . $r_0 = -2$ , or equivalent, $15$ . $f(-2)=17$ and $f'(-2)=-32$ , so $r_1=-2+\\frac{17}{32}\\pmod{289}$ . We already found the inverse of $32$ modulo $17$ , so this case has $r_1=-1+17\\cdot 8\\equiv 134 \\pmod{289}$ . $r_0 = 8$ . $f(8)=4097$ and $f'(8)=2048$ , so $r_1=-2+\\frac{4097}{2048}\\pmod{289}$ , and we need to find the inverse of $32\\equiv 8$ modulo $17$ . We already know the inverse of $8$ is $15$ , so we end up with $r_1=8-4097\\cdot 15\\equiv 110\\pmod{289}$ . $r_0 = -8$ , or equivalent, $9$ . $f(-8)=4097$ and $f'(-8)=-2048$ , so $r_1=-8+\\frac{4097}{2048}\\pmod{289}$ . We already found the inverse of $2048$ modulo $17$ , so this case has $r_1=-8+4097\\cdot 15\\equiv 179\\pmod{289}$ .\n\nThus, out of our four values for $m$ , the smallest is $\\boxed{110}$ . Solution by juwushu .\n\nSolution 3 (Easy, given specialized knowledge):\nNote that $n^4 + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ means $\\text{ord}_{p}(n) = 8 \\mid p-1.$ The smallest prime that does this is $17$ and $2^4 + 1 = 17$ for example. Now let $g$ be a primitive root of $17^2.$ The satisfying $n$ are of the form, $g^{\\frac{p(p-1)}{8}}, g^{3\\frac{p(p-1)}{8}}, g^{5\\frac{p(p-1)}{8}}, g^{7\\frac{p(p-1)}{8}}.$ So if we find one such $n$ , then all $n$ are $n, n^3, n^5, n^7.$ Consider the $2$ from before. Note $17^2 \\mid 2^{4 \\cdot 17} + 1$ by LTE. Hence the possible $n$ are, $2^{17}, 2^{51}, 2^{85}, 2^{119}.$ Some modular arithmetic yields that $2^{51} \\equiv \\boxed{110}$ is the least value.\n\n~Aaryabhatta1\n\nSolution 4 (Unfinished):\nWe work in the ring \\(\\mathbb Z/289\\mathbb Z\\) and use the formula \\[\\sqrt[4]{-1}=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac12}\\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac12}.\\] Since \\(-\\frac12=144\\), the expression becomes \\(\\pm12\\pm12i\\), and it is easily calculated via Hensel that \\(i=38\\), thus giving an answer of \\(\\boxed{110}\\)."}

Place $AB$ on the floor. Construct an isosceles vertical triangle with $AB$ as its base and $M$ as the top vertex. Place $CD$ on the top vertex parallel to the ground with midpoint $M.$ Observe that $CD$ can rotate about its midpoint. At a certain angle, we observe that the lengths satisfy those given in the problem. If we project $AB$ onto the plane of $CD$ , let the minor angle $\\theta$ be this discrepancy.\n\nBy Median formula or Stewart's theorem, $AM = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{2AC^2 + 2AD^2 - CD^2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{33}}{2}.$ Consequently the area of $\\triangle AMB$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2} \\left (\\sqrt{(\\frac{3\\sqrt{33}}{2})^2 - (\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2})^2} \\right ) = 4\\sqrt{41}.$ Note the altitude $8$ is also the distance between the parallel planes containing $AB$ and $CD.$\n\nBy Distance Formula, \\begin{align*} (\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}CD \\cos{\\theta})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}CD \\sin{\\theta}^2) + (8)^2 &= AC^2 = 80 \\\\ (\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}CD \\cos{\\theta})^2 + (\\frac{1}{2}CD \\sin{\\theta}^2) + (8)^2 &= AD^2 = 89 \\\\ \\implies CD \\cos{\\theta} \\sqrt{41} &= 9 \\\\ \\sin{\\theta} &= \\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{9}{41})^2} = \\frac{40}{41}. \\end{align*} Then the volume of the tetrahedron is given by $\\frac{1}{3} [AMB] \\cdot CD \\sin{\\theta} = \\frac{160}{3}.$\n\nThe volume of the tetrahedron can also be segmented into four smaller tetrahedrons from $I$ w.r.t each of the faces. If $r$ is the inradius, i.e the distance to the faces, then $\\frac{1}{3} r([ABC] + [ABD] + [ACD] + [BCD])$ must the volume. Each face has the same area by SSS congruence, and by Heron's it is $\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(a + b + c)(a + b - c)(c + (a-b))(c -(a - b))} = 6\\sqrt{21}.$\n\nTherefore the answer is, $\\dfrac{3 \\frac{160}{3}}{24 \\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\implies \\boxed{104}.$\n\n~Aaryabhatta1\n\nSolution 7 (simplest way to calculate [ABCD]):\nAfter finding that $ABCD$ can be inscribed in a $4\\times5\\times8$ box, note that $[ABCD]=\\mathbf{box}-(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{4}{3})(4)(5)(8)=\\frac{160}{3}$ , where the third term describes the area of 4 congruent right tetrahedrons whose right angle is at the apex and whose apex lengths are 4, 5, and 8. Then proceed as in Solution 3.\n\n~clarkculus\n\nSolution 8 (fast):\nObserve that $ABCD$ can be inscribed in a $4\\times5\\times8$ box, which gives the coordinates of the points: we have $A=(8,0,0)$ , $B=(8,5,4)$ , $C=(0,0,4)$ and $D=(0,5,0)$ . Recall the formula $V=\\frac{1}{3}RS$ , where $V$ is the volume of the tetrahedron, $S$ is the surface area, and $R$ is the insphere radius. Using the fact that the faces of $ABCD$ have equal area and that $V=\\frac{1}{3}[ACD] \\times h$ , where $h$ is the distance from plane $ACD$ to $B$ , we can rearrange to get $R=\\frac{h}{4}$ . We compute that the the equation of plane $ACD$ is $5x+8y+10z-40=0$ , and applying point-to-plane gives $h=\\frac{\\vert 5(8)+8(5)+10(4)-40 \\vert}{\\sqrt{5^2+8^2+10^2}}=\\frac{80}{\\sqrt{189}} \\implies R=\\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63} \\implies \\boxed{104}$ .\n\n~bomberdoodles\n\nSolution 9 (Analytical Geometry):\nLike in Solution 1, we have $A = (0,0,0)$ , $B = (4,5,0)$ , $C = (0,5,8)$ , $D = (4,0,8)$ . If we let the inradius be $r$ , then the volume of the tetrahedron is equal to $\\frac{1}{3}[ABC]r + \\frac{1}{3}[BCD]r + \\frac{1}{3}[ABD]r + \\frac{1}{3}[ACD]r = V$ by the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3}Ah$ . Also note that $[ABC] = [BCD] = [ABD] = [ACD]$ because they all have the same side lengths. So, if we let $[ABC] = A$ , then $\\frac{4}{3}Ar = V$ , so $r = \\frac{3V}{4A}$ . Now, all we need to do is to find V and A. We note that the area of the triangle $[ABC] = |\\frac{\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}}{2}|$ . Also, if we let the normal vector from $\\Delta ABC$ to be $\\bold{n}$ , the height $h$ from $D$ to $\\Delta ABC$ is $\\overrightarrow{AD} \\cdot \\hat{\\bold{n}} = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{AD} \\cdot \\bold{n}}{\\bold{|n|}}$ . Therefore, the volume of the tetrahedron is equal to $\\frac{1}{3}[ABC]h = \\frac{1}{3}|\\frac{\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}}{2}|\\frac{\\overrightarrow{AD} \\cdot \\bold{n}}{\\bold{|n|}} = \\frac{1}{6}|\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}|\\frac{\\overrightarrow{AD} \\cdot \\bold{n}}{\\bold{|n|}}$ . Now, we notice that $\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}$ is a normal vector of the $\\Delta ABC$ because the cross product of two vectors is always perpendicular to both of the vectors, and both of the vectors lie in the plane of $\\Delta ABC$ . This means that we can let $\\bold{n} = \\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}$ . So, the volume of the tetrahedron is $V = \\frac{1}{6}|\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}|\\frac{\\overrightarrow{AD} \\cdot (\\bold{\\overrightarrow {AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}})}{\\bold{|\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}|}} = \\frac{1}{6}\\overrightarrow{AD} \\cdot (\\bold{\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}})$ . The expression $\\overrightarrow{AD} \\cdot (\\bold{\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}})$ is more commonly known as a box product and can be used to find the volume of any parallelepiped. We know that $\\overrightarrow{AB} = (4,5,0)$ , $\\overrightarrow{AC} = (0,5,8)$ , and $\\overrightarrow{AD} = (4,0,8)$ . Now, $\\overrightarrow{AB} \\times \\overrightarrow{AC} = (8*5-5*0, 0*0-8*4, 4*5-5*0) = (40, -32, 20)$ . So, $\\overrightarrow{AD} \\cdot (\\bold{\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}}) = (4,0,8) \\cdot (40,-32,20) = 4*40 + 0*-32 + 8*20 = 320$ . So, $V = \\frac{1}{6}\\overrightarrow{AD} \\cdot (\\bold{\\overrightarrow{AB}\\times\\overrightarrow{AC}}) = \\frac{320}{6} = \\frac{160}{3}$ . Now $[ABC]$ is just equal to $\\frac{1}{2}|\\overrightarrow{AB} \\times \\overrightarrow{AC}|$ as it is half the parallelogram. So, we have $A = \\frac{1}{2}|\\overrightarrow{AB} \\times \\overrightarrow{AC}| = \\frac{1}{2}|(40,-32,20)| = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{3024}$ . So, $r = \\frac{3V}{4A} = \\frac{160}{2\\sqrt{3024}}$ . This expression can be simplified to $\\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}$ . So, our answer is $20 + 63 + 21 = \\boxed{104}$ .\n\n- Rutvik Arora (plz sub to https://www.youtube.com/@themathguy6302 )"}

However, this is not our answer! This is simply the length of the box; we want the radius of the sphere enclosing it. We know that the diameter of the sphere is the diagonal of the box, and the 3D Pythagorean Theorem can give us the space diagonal.

And, again, we see: \\[23/r+4+23r/4=27\\] giving rise to r=2.\nFor a cuboid inside a circle, we know:the radius is half its diagonal or, can we not say, \\[r^2=(L^2+b^2+h^2)/4\\] or  here, \\[r^2=(128+529)/64\\] so here, \\[p+q=657+64=721\\]\n\n~Grammaticus\n\nSolution 5:\nThis problem essentially boils down to maximizing the value of $x+y+z$ (where $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ denote the dimensions of the box) given $xy+xz+yz=27$ and $xyz=23$ . After doing so, we can calculate $r^2$ using $r^2=\\frac{(x+y+z)^2-54}{4}$ (as in Solution 2). We can turn $x+y+z$ into an expression in terms of only $x$ and use the method of critical points. Since $xyz=23$ , we have $yz=\\frac{23}{x}$ and thus $xy+xz+yz=x(y+z)+\\frac{23}{x}=27$ . Isolating $y+z$ , we find $y+z=\\frac{27-\\frac{23}{x}}{x}$ , so \\[x+y+z=x+\\frac{27-\\frac{23}{x}}{x}=x+\\frac{27x-23}{x^2}=x+27\\cdot x^{-1}-23\\cdot x^{-2}.\\] We have turned $x+y+z$ into an equation in $x$ , using all conditions the problem has given us. We proceed with calculus. The maximum value of this function in $x$ is one of the critical points of this function, which can be calculated by equating the function's derivative with $0$ . Using the power rule, the derivative of $f(x)=x+27\\cdot x^{-1}-23\\cdot x^{-2}$ is $f'(x)=1-27\\cdot x^{-2}+46\\cdot x^{-3}$ . Equating $f'(x)$ to zero, we get \\[1-27\\cdot x^{-2}+46\\cdot x^{-3}=0 \\implies x^3-27x+46=0\\] The roots of this can be found using the rational root theorem, yielding $x=2$ or $-1\\pm 2\\sqrt{6}$ . Don't forget -- $x$ must be positive, so the only possible candidates of $x$ to maximize $f(x)$ are $2$ and $2\\sqrt{6}-1$ . Plugging both of them into $f(x)=x+27\\cdot x^{-1}-23\\cdot x^{-2}$ , we find $x=2$ yields a greater result, $\\frac{39}{4}$ . Thus, the maximum value of $x+y+z=f(x)$ is $\\frac{39}{4}$ . Therefore, the value of $r^2$ is \\[\\frac{(\\frac{39}{4})^2-54}{4}=\\frac{657}{64} \\implies p+q=\\boxed{721}.\\]\n\n~ Mathkiddie\n\nSolution 6 (If you don't notice that two of the side lengths have to be equal):\nFrom the previous solutions we can see that we have to maximize $m$ in the expression $x^3 - mx^2 + 27x - 23 = 0$ such that $x^3 - mx^2 + 27x - 23 = 0$ has $3$ real and positive roots since the roots correspond to the side lengths of the rectangle. To do this we can use synthetic division to divide this expression by $(x - r)$ for some arbitrary root $r$ to try and see how $m$ relates to the roots. After doing synthetic division, we get \\[(x^2 + (r - m)x + (27 + r^2 - rm) + \\frac{r^3 - r^2m + 27r - 23}{x - r})(x - r) = x^3 - mx^2 + 27x - 23\\] Since we defined r to be a root of the expression, it must divide into it with no remainder, meaning that $r^3-r^2m+27r-23=0$ or $m = r + \\frac{27}{r} - \\frac{23}{r^2}$\n\nWe can now substitute this value into $x^2 + (r-m)x + (27 + r^2 - rm)=0$ to get\n\n$x^2 + (\\frac{23}{r^2} - \\frac{27}{r})x + \\frac{23}{r} = 0$ .\n\nMultiplying everything by $r^2$ yields $r^2x^2 + (23-27r)x + 23r = 0$ .\n\nWe now have to find the maximum value of $r$ for which this expression has 2 roots, since $m$ strictly increases\nwith $r$ from our previous expression of $m = r + \\frac{27}{r} - \\frac{23}{r^2}$\n\nTo do this, we can find the discriminant of $r^2x^2 + (23-27r)x + 23r = 0$ and find the maximum value of $r$ for which it is positive.\n\nThe discriminant of this expression is $-92r^3 + 729r^2 - 1232r + 529$ , and after using the rational root theorem we can find $\\frac{23}{4}$ as a root.\n\nThe remaining expression is $(x - \\frac{23}{4})(-92x^2 + 200x - 92)$ .\nWe can quickly see using the quadratic formula that $\\frac{23}{4}$ is the largest root, meaning that $r=\\frac{23}{4}$ is the largest value that a root of $x^3 - mx^2 + 27x - 23 = 0$ can have for which $x^3 - mx^2 + 27x - 23=0$ has $3$ positive, real solutions. From here, we can substitute this value back into the expression for $m$ , giving us $m = \\frac{39}{4}$ . The length of the radius squared is $\\frac{m^2-54}{4}=\\frac{657}{64}$ and $657+64=\\boxed{721}$\n\n~Lapcas"}

Suppose the list has two elements. To meet the mode condition, both must equal $9$ , but this does not satisfy the other conditions.\n\nNext, suppose the list has six elements. If there were at least three $9$ s, then the other elements would sum to at most $30-27=3$ . Since the elements are positive integers, this can only be achieved with the set $\\{1,1,1,9,9,9\\}$ , which violates the unique mode condition. Therefore, there must be exactly two $9$ s, and the other four elements must be distinct to satisfy the unique mode condition. Two sets of four unique positive integers add to $12$ : $\\{1,2,3,6\\}$ and $\\{1,2,4,5\\}$ . Neither can act as the remaining four elements since both possibilities violate the constraint that the median is an integer.\n\nNext, suppose the list had at least eight elements. For the sake of contradiction, suppose the third-largest element was at least $9$ . Then, since every element is a positive integer, the minimum sum would be $1+1+1+1+1+9+9+9>30$ . So, to satisfy the unique mode condition, there must be exactly two $9$ s, and the other elements must be distinct. But then the minimum sum is $1+2+3+4+5+6+9+9>30$ , so the sum constraint can never be satisfied. From these deductions, we conclude that the list has exactly four elements.\n\nNote that no element can appear three times in the list, or else the middle-two-largest elements would be equal, violating the condition that the median is not in the list. Therefore, to satisfy the unique mode condition, the list contains two $9$ s and two other distinct integers that add to $30-18=12$ . Five sets of two unique positive integers add to $12$ : $\\{1,11\\}$ , $\\{2,10\\}$ , $\\{3,9\\}$ , $\\{4,8\\}$ , and $\\{5,7\\}$ . The first four options violate the median condition (either they make the median one of the list elements, or they make the median a non-integer). Thus, the set must be $\\{5,7,9,9\\}$ , and the sum of the squares of these elements is $25+49+81+81=\\boxed{236}$ .\n\n-ltihoen"}

There can be 5,4,3,2, or 1 black chip. The same goes for white chips, so we will multiply by 2 at the end. There is $1$ way to select $5$ cells with black chips. Because of the 2nd condition, there can be no white, and the grid must be all black- $1$ way . There are $5$ ways to select 4 cells with black chips. We now consider the row that does not contain a black chip. The first cell must be blank, and the remaining $4$ cells have $2^4-1$ different ways, since each cell can be white or blank( $-1$ comes from all blank). This gives us $75$ ways. Notice that for 3,2 or 1 black chips on the left there is a pattern. Once the first blank row is chosen, the rest of the blank rows must be ordered similarly. For example, with 2 black chips on the left, there will be 3 blank rows. There are 15 ways for the first row to be chosen, and the following 2 rows must have the same order. Thus, The number of ways for 3,2,and 1 black chips is $10*15$ , $10*15$ , $5*15$ . Adding these up, we have $1+75+150+150+75 = 451$ . Multiplying this by 2, we get $\\boxed{902}$ .\n~westwoodmonster\n\nSolution 2:\nNote that the answer is equivalent to the number of ways to choose rows and columns that the white chips occupy, as once those are chosen, there is only one way to place the chips, and every way to place the chips corresponds to a set of rows and columns occupied by the white pieces.\n\nIf the white pieces occupy none of the rows, then because they don't appear on the board, they will not occupy any of the columns. Similar logic can be applied to show that if white pieces occupy all of the rows, they will also occupy all of the columns.\n\nThe number of sets of rows and columns that white can occupy are $2^{5} - 2 = 30$ each, accounting for the empty and full set.\nSo, including the board with 25 white pieces and the board with 25 black pieces, the answer is $30^{2}+2 = \\boxed{902}$\n\nSolution 3:\nCase 1: All chips on the grid have the same color.\n\nIn this case, all cells are occupied with chips with the same color.\nTherefore, the number of configurations in this case is 2.\n\nCase 2: Both black and white chips are on the grid.\n\nObservation 1: Each colored chips must occupy at least one column and one row.\n\nThis is because, for each given color, there must be at least one chip. Therefore, all chips placed in the cells that are in the same row or the same column with this given chip must have the same color with this chip.\n\nObservation 2: Each colored chips occupy at most 4 rows and 4 columns.\n\nThis directly follows from Observation 1.\n\nObservation 3: For each color, if all chips in this color occupy columns with $x$ -coordinates $\\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots, x_m \\right\\}$ and rows with $y$ -coordinates $\\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots, y_n \\right\\}$ , then every cell $\\left( x, y \\right)$ with $x \\in \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\in \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$ is occupied by a chip with the same color.\n\nThis is because, if there is any cell in this region occupied by a chip with a different color, it violates Condition 2.\nIf there is any cell in this region that is empty, then it violates Condition 3.\n\nObservation 4: For each color, if all chips in this color occupy columns with $x$ -coordinates $\\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots, x_m \\right\\}$ and rows with $y$ -coordinates $\\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots, y_n \\right\\}$ , then every cell $\\left( x, y \\right)$ with $x \\notin \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\in \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$ , or $x \\in \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\notin \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$ is empty.\n\nThis is because, if there is any cell in this region occupied by a chip with a different color, it violates Condition 2.\n\nObservation 5: For each color, if all chips in this color occupy columns with $x$ -coordinates $\\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots, x_m \\right\\}$ and rows with $y$ -coordinates $\\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots, y_n \\right\\}$ , then every cell $\\left( x, y \\right)$ with $x \\notin \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\notin \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$ is occupied by chips with the different color.\n\nThis follows from Condition 3.\n\nBy using the above observations, the number of feasible configurations in this case is given by\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{n=1}^4 \\sum_{m=1}^4 \\binom{5}{n} \\binom{5}{m}\n& = \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^4 \\binom{5}{n} \\right)\n\\left( \\sum_{m=1}^4 \\binom{5}{m} \\right) \\\\\n& = \\left( 2^5 - 2 \\right)^2 \\\\\n& = 900 .\n\\end{align*}\n\nPutting all cases together, the total number of feasible configurations is $2 + 900 =  \\boxed{\\textbf{(902) }}$ .\n\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)\n\nSolution 4 (Notationless Solution 3):\nWe rely on 3 simple observations: \\[~~~~~~~~~\\] Observation 1: An intersection of a row and a column must be filled if they are the same color.\nProof: If not, we can just fill it with a chip of the color, violating rule #3. \\[~~~~~~~~~\\] Observation 2: An intersection of a row and column must not be filled if they are of different colors.\nProof: If it is filled, it would violate rule #2, as it will be different from one of the colors of the row/column that intersect. \\[~~~~~~~`\\] Observation 3: Every row and column must have a defined color.\nProof: If it didn't, there would be no chips in this row/column. Then, a chip could be placed in any intersection with this row/column in the intersecting row/column's color, violating rule #3. \\[~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\] From observations 1 and 2, we could tile the board given the colors of its rows and columns, and it is clear that every tiling must correspond to a selection of colors for the rows and columns. However, observation 3 means we can have all rows be the same color or all columns be the same color but we can have all rows and columns be the same color, as if all rows were white but a column was black, that column can't have any chips, and it doesn't have a defined color, which is not allowed. There are exactly $2^5-2=30$ ways we can color the rows such that they are not all the same color, and $30$ ways for the columns. We must add back $2$ for when all the rows and columns are the same color, so the answer is $30^2+2=\\boxed{902}.$\n\n~BS2012\n\nSolution 5:\nObserve how each grid is uniquely determined by a choice of \"black rows\" and \"white rows.\" That is, every intersection of a black row with a black column will be a black cell, and likewise with the white rows and columns, but every intersection of a black row with a white column will remain empty.\n\nHowever, if we have all the rows or columns be black or white, then the other dimension will become redundant. For example, if all of our rows are black, the ways the columns are colored doesn't matter because the whole grid will have to be filled with only black cells.\n\nHence, the number of sets of rows and columns that white can occupy are $2^{5} - 2 = 30$ each. But including the board with 25 white pieces and the board with 25 black pieces, the answer is $30^{2}+2 = \\boxed{902}$ .\n\n~xHypotenuse\n\nSolution 6:\nWe can denote X as a black pieces, O as a white pieces, and _ as a blank pieces.\n\nWe can fill up the left column in any of the 60 ways (2 colors and 30 arrangements as we cannot have the empty column as it will violate the condition, and filling it up all the way only gives us 1 way to fill the grid), WLOG we can fill it out like the following:\n\nX _ _ _ _\n\n_ _ _ _ _\n\nX _ _ _ _\n\nX _ _ _ _\n\n_ _ _ _ _\n\nNow, let's examine the topmost blank row, in which we can fill out in 15 ways in the color that we didn't use when filling out the leftmost column (we cannot fill it out on the very left since that would violate the condition, and we cannot have an empty row as it would violate the condition). WLOG, we can fill it out like the following:\n\nX _ _ _ _\n\n_ _ O _ O\n\nX _ _ _ _\n\nX _ _ _ _\n\n_ _ _ _ _\n\nHowever, notice that there's only 1 way to fill out all the pieces given the arrangement above. This involves filling any row with an O as how we filled out the topmost row, and strategically filling out the rows with an X's such that they do not share any column with an O:\n\nX X _ X _\n\n_ _ O _ O\n\nX X _ X _\n\nX X _ X _\n\n_ _ O _ O\n\nSo, we have a total of $60\\times15$ ways to fill out the board, but we also need to add 2 cases if it's completely covered with a white or black piece, giving us $\\boxed{902}$ .\n\n~aleyang"}

Furthermore, $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle ADC$ are both subtended by the same arc $AC$ , so $\\angle ABC \\cong \\angle ADC.$ Therefore by AA similarity, $\\triangle ABL \\sim \\triangle ADC$ .\nFrom this we can say that \\[\\frac{AB}{AD} = \\frac{AL}{AC} \\implies AB \\cdot AC = AL \\cdot AD\\]\n\nSince $AD$ is a chord of the circle and $OI$ is a perpendicular from the center to that chord, $OI$ must bisect $AD$ . This can be seen by drawing $OD$ and recognizing that this creates two congruent right triangles. Therefore, \\[AD = 2 \\cdot ID \\implies AB \\cdot AC = 2 \\cdot AL \\cdot ID\\]\n\nWe have successfully represented $AB \\cdot AC$ in terms of $AL$ and $ID$ . Solution 1.2 will explain an alternate method to get a similar relationship, and then we'll rejoin and finish off the solution.\n\nSolution 1.2:\n$\\angle ALB \\cong \\angle DLC$ by vertical angles and $\\angle LBA \\cong \\angle CDA$ because both are subtended by arc $AC$ . Thus $\\triangle ABL \\sim \\triangle CDL$ .\n\nThus \\[\\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{AL}{CL} \\implies AB = CD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{CL}\\]\n\nSymmetrically, we get $\\triangle ALC \\sim \\triangle BLD$ , so \\[\\frac{AC}{BD} = \\frac{AL}{BL} \\implies AC = BD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{BL}\\]\n\nSubstituting, we  get \\[AB \\cdot AC = CD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{CL} \\cdot BD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{BL}\\]\n\n$\\textbf{Lemma 1:}\\quad$ $BD = CD = ID$\n\nProof:\n\nWe commence angle chasing: we know $\\angle DBC \\cong DAC = \\gamma$ .

Then $d^2 = R \\cdot (R-2r)$ , where $R$ is the circumradius of the triangle and $r$ is the inradius of the triangle.\n\nProof:\n\nConstruct the following diagram:\n\n[asy] size(300); import olympiad; real c=8.1,a=5*(c+sqrt(c^2-64))/6,b=5*(c-sqrt(c^2-64))/6; pair B=(0,0),C=(c,0), D = (c/2-0.01, -2.26), E = (c/2-0.01,0); pair A = (c/3,8.65*c/10); pair F = (2*c/3-0.14, 4-0.29); pair G = (c/2-0.68,0); draw(circumcircle(A,B,C)); pair I=incenter(A,B,C); pair O=circumcenter(A,B,C); pair L=extension(A,I,C,B); dot(I^^O^^A^^B^^C^^D^^L^^F); draw(A--L); draw(A--D); draw(I--F); path midangle(pair d,pair e,pair f) {return e--e+((f-e)/length(f-e)+(d-e)/length(d-e))/2;} draw(C--B--D--cycle); draw(A--C--B); draw(A--B); draw(A--I); draw(incircle(A,B,C)); label(\"$B$\",B,SW); label(\"$C$\",C,SE); label(\"$A$\",A,N); label(\"$D$\",D,S); label(\"$I$\",I,NW); label(\"$L$\",L,SW); label(\"$O$\",O,S); label(\"$F$\",F,NE); label(\"$\\gamma$\",A,5*dir(midangle(B,A,I)),fontsize(8)); label(\"$\\gamma$\",A,5*dir(midangle(I,A,C)),fontsize(8));  pair H = (10*c/8-1.46,2*c/3-1.85), J = (-0.55,1.4); dot(H^^J); label(\"$H$\", H, E); label(\"$J$\", J, W);   draw(I--O); draw(I--H); draw(I--J); draw(rightanglemark(I,F,A)); [/asy]\n\nLet $OI = d$ , $OH = R$ , $IF = r$ . By the Power of a Point, $IH \\cdot IJ = AI \\cdot ID$ . $IH = R+d$ and $IJ = R-d$ , so \\[(R+d) \\cdot (R-d) = AI \\cdot ID = AI \\cdot CD\\]\n\nNow consider $\\triangle ACD$ . Since all three points lie on the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$ , the two triangles have the same circumcircle. Thus we can apply law of sines and we get $\\frac{CD}{\\sin(\\angle DAC)} = 2R$ . This implies\n\n\\[(R+d)\\cdot (R-d) = AI \\cdot 2R \\cdot \\sin(\\angle DAC)\\]\n\nAlso, $\\sin(\\angle DAC)) = \\sin(\\angle IAF))$ , and $\\triangle IAF$ is right. Therefore \\[\\sin(\\angle IAF) = \\frac{IF}{AI} = \\frac{r}{AI}\\]\n\nPlugging in, we have\n\n\\[(R+d)\\cdot (R-d) = AI \\cdot 2R \\cdot \\frac{r}{AI} = 2R \\cdot r\\]\n\nThus \\[R^2-d^2 = 2R \\cdot r \\implies d^2 = R \\cdot (R-2r)\\]\n\nNow we can finish up our solution. We know that $AB \\cdot AC = 3 \\cdot ID^2$ . Since $ID = AI$ , $AB \\cdot AC = 3 \\cdot AI^2$ . Since $\\triangle AOI$ is right, we can apply the pythagorean theorem: $AI^2 = AO^2-OI^2 = 13^2-OI^2$ .\n\nPlugging in from Euler's formula, $OI^2 = 13 \\cdot (13 - 2 \\cdot 6) = 13$ .\n\nThus $AI^2 = 169-13 = 156$ .\n\nFinally $AB \\cdot AC = 3 \\cdot AI^2 = 3 \\cdot 156 = \\textbf{468}$ .\n\n~KingRavi\n\nSolution 2 (Excenters):\nBy Euler's formula $OI^{2}=R(R-2r)$ , we have $OI^{2}=13(13-12)=13$ . Thus, by the Pythagorean theorem, $AI^{2}=13^{2}-13=156$ . Let $AI\\cap(ABC)=M$ ; notice $\\triangle AOM$ is isosceles and $\\overline{OI}\\perp\\overline{AM}$ which is enough to imply that $I$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AM}$ , and $M$ itself is the midpoint of $II_{a}$ where $I_{a}$ is the $A$ -excenter of $\\triangle ABC$ . Therefore, $AI=IM=MI_{a}=\\sqrt{156}$ and \\[AB\\cdot AC=AI\\cdot AI_{a}=3\\cdot AI^{2}=\\boxed{468}.\\]\n\nNote that this problem is extremely similar to 2019 CIME I/14 .\n\nSolution 3:\nDenote $AB=a, AC=b, BC=c$ . By the given condition, $\\frac{abc}{4A}=13; \\frac{2A}{a+b+c}=6$ , where $A$ is the area of $\\triangle{ABC}$ .\n\nMoreover, since $OI\\bot AI$ , the second intersection of the line $AI$ and $(ABC)$ is the reflection of $A$ about $I$ , denote that as $D$ . By the incenter-excenter lemma with Ptolemy's Theorem, $DI=BD=CD=\\frac{AD}{2}\\implies BD(a+b)=2BD\\cdot c\\implies a+b=2c$ .\n\nThus, we have $\\frac{2A}{a+b+c}=\\frac{2A}{3c}=6, A=9c$ . Now, we have $\\frac{abc}{4A}=\\frac{abc}{36c}=\\frac{ab}{36}=13\\implies ab=\\boxed{468}$\n\n~Bluesoul\n\nSolution 4 (Trig):\nDenote by $R$ and $r$ the circumradius and inradius, respectively.\n\nFirst, we have \\[ r = 4 R \\sin \\frac{A}{2} \\sin \\frac{B}{2} \\sin \\frac{C}{2} \\hspace{1cm} (1) \\]\n\nSecond, because $AI \\perp IO$ ,\n\\begin{align*}\nAI & = AO \\cos \\angle IAO \\\\\n& = AO \\cos \\left( 90^\\circ - C - \\frac{A}{2} \\right) \\\\\n& = AO \\sin \\left( C + \\frac{A}{2} \\right) \\\\\n& = R \\sin \\left( C + \\frac{180^\\circ - B - C}{2} \\right) \\\\\n& = R \\cos \\frac{B - C}{2} .\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus,\n\\begin{align*}\nr & = AI \\sin \\frac{A}{2} \\\\\n& = R \\sin \\frac{A}{2} \\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} \\hspace{1cm} (2)\n\\end{align*}\n\nTaking $(1) - (2)$ , we get \\[4 \\sin \\frac{B}{2} \\sin \\frac{C}{2} = \\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} .\\]\n\nWe have\n\\begin{align*}\n2 \\sin \\frac{B}{2} \\sin \\frac{C}{2}\n& = - \\cos \\frac{B+C}{2} + \\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} .\n\\end{align*}\n\nPlugging this into the above equation, we get \\[\\cos \\frac{B-C}{2} = 2 \\cos \\frac{B+C}{2} . \\hspace{1cm} (3)\\]\n\nNow, we analyze Equation (2).

Next, from $A$ , construct tangent lines to the incircle meeting the circumcirlce at point $B$ and $C$ , say, as shown in the diagram. By Euler's theorem (relating the distance between $O$ and $I$ to the circumradius and inradius), we have \\[OI = \\sqrt{R^2 - 2rR} = \\sqrt{13}.\\] This leads to \\[AI = \\sqrt{R^2 - OI^2} = \\sqrt{156}.\\] Let $P$ be the point of tangency where the incircle meets the side $\\overline{AC}$ . Now we denote \\[\\theta \\coloneqq \\angle BAI = \\angle IAP \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad \\phi \\coloneqq \\angle OAI.\\] Notice that $\\angle BAO = \\angle BAI - \\angle OAI = \\theta - \\phi$ . Finally, the crux move is to recognize \\[AB = 2R \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad AC = 2R \\cos(\\theta + \\phi)\\] since $O$ is the circumcenter. Then multiply these two expressions and apply the compound-angle formula to get\n\\begin{aligned}\nAB \\cdot AC\n&= 4R^2 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\cos(\\theta + \\phi) \\\\[0.3em]\n&= 4R^2\\left(\n\\cos^2\\theta \\cos^2\\phi - \\sin^2\\theta \\sin^2\\phi\n\\right) \\\\[0.3em]\n&= 4\\cos^2\\theta(\\underbrace{R\\cos\\phi}_{AI \\, = \\, \\sqrt{156}})^2 - 4\\sin^2\\theta(\\underbrace{R\\sin\\phi}_{OI \\, = \\, \\sqrt{13}})^2 \\\\[0.3em]\n&= 52 (12\\cos^2\\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta) \\\\[0.3em]\nAB \\cdot AC\n&= 52 (12 - 13\\sin^2\\theta),\n\\end{aligned}\nwhere in the last equality, we make use of the substitution $\\cos^2\\theta = 1 - \\sin^2\\theta$ . Looking at $\\triangle AIP$ , we learn that $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{r}{AI} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{156}}$ which means $\\sin^2 \\theta = \\frac{3}{13}$ . Hence we have \\[AB \\cdot AC = 52\\left( 12 - 13 \\cdot \\tfrac{3}{13} \\right) = 52 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{468}.\\] This completes the solution\n\n-- VensL.\n\nSolution 6 (Close to Solution 3):\n2024 AIME II 10.png\n\nDenote $E = \\odot ABC \\cap AI, AB = c, AC = b, BC=a, r$ is inradius. \\[AO = EO = R \\implies AI = EI.\\] It is known that $\\frac {AI}{EI} = \\frac {b+c}{a} – 1 = 1 \\implies b + c = 2a.$\n\nPoints on bisectors\n\n\\[[ABC] =\\frac{ (a+b+c) r}{2} = \\frac {3ar}{2} = \\frac {abc}{4R} \\implies bc = 6Rr = \\boxed{468}.\\] vladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss\n\nSolution 7:\nCall side $BC = a$ , and similarly label the other sides. Note that ${OI}^2 = R^2 - 2Rr$ . Also note that $AO = R$ , so by the right angle, $AI = \\sqrt{2Rr}$ . However, we can double Angle Bisector theorem. The length of the angle bisector from A is $\\sqrt{(bc)(1 - \\frac{a^2}{(b+c)^2})}$ . As a direct result, the length AI simplifies down to $\\frac{\\sqrt{(bc)(b+c-a)}}{\\sqrt{{a+b+c}}}$ .\n\nDraw the incircle and call the tangent to side AB F. Then, $AF = \\frac{b+c-a}{2}$ . But this length, by Pythagorean, is $\\sqrt{120}$ , so $b+c-a = 2\\sqrt{120}$ .\n\nAlso note that the area of the triangle is $[ABC] = \\frac{abc}{52}$ , by $\\frac{abc}{4S} = R$ . By the incircle, we know that $\\sin{\\frac{A}{2}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{156}}$ , and similarly, $\\cos{\\frac{A}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{120}}{\\sqrt{156}}$ . By double-angle, $\\sin A = \\frac{\\sqrt{120}}{13}$ . But the area of the triangle $[ABC]$ is simply $\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A$ , which is also $2\\sqrt{120}bc$ . But we know this is $abc$ from above, so $a = 2\\sqrt{120}$ . As a direct result, $a+b+c =  6\\sqrt{120}$ .\n\nApply this to the formula $\\frac{\\sqrt{(bc)(b+c-a)}}{\\sqrt{a+b+c}}$ listed above to get $2Rr = 156 = \\frac{bc}{3}$ , so $bc = 468$ . We're done. - sepehr2010\n\nSolution 8:\nLet the intersection of the $A$ -angle bisector and the circumcircle be $M$ , and denote the $A$ -excenter as $I_A$ . Denote the tangent to the incircle from $AC$ as $E$ and the tangent to the excircle from $AC$ as $E_A$ .\n\nNotice that our perpendicular condition implies $AI = IM$ , and Incenter-Excenter gives $IM = MI_A$ . Thus we have $AI_A = 3AI$ . From similar triangles we get $3(s-a) = 3AE = AE_A = s$ . This implies $a = \\frac23 S$ .\n\nUsing areas we have that $\\frac{abc}{4R} = rs$ . Substituting gives $\\frac{sbc}{6R} = rs \\implies bc = 6Rr = \\boxed{468}$ and we're done. - thoom\n\nSolution 9:\nWe know that the area of $\\triangle{ABC}$ is equal to $\\frac{abc}{4R}$ , but is also equal to $\\frac{a+b+c}{2}r$ , where R is the circumcircle and r is the incircle. So, $abc = 156(a+b+c)$ . Let's extend $AI$ so it intersects the circumcircle of $\\triangle{ABC}$ at $P$ . Something that we see is that $\\triangle{AIO}$ is congruent to $\\triangle{PIO}$ . Something else that we notice that since $AI$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle{A}$ , $P$ is the midpoint of arc $BC$ . Now, let's try calculating $AI$ . By Euler's Theorem, $OI^{2} = R^{2} - 2Rr$ where R is the circumcircle and r is the incircle, so $OI = \\sqrt{13}$ . Using Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle{AOI}$ gives us $AI = 3\\sqrt{39}$ as we know that $AO$ is 13.\n\nHowever, since $\\triangle{AOI}$ is congruent to $\\triangle{POI}$ , $PI = 3\\sqrt{39}$ . Since we know that $P$ is the midpoint of arc $BC$ , we can apply the Incenter-Excenter Lemma to get that $BP = 3\\sqrt{39}$ and $CP = 3\\sqrt{39}$ . Now, we can use Ptolemy's Theorem on quadrilateral ABPC:\n\n$(b+c)(3\\sqrt{39}) = a \\times 6\\sqrt{39}$\n\nHowever, we know that $abc = 156(a+b+c)$ , so we can solve for a! So, $abc - 156c = 156a + 156b$ . Dividing gives us $a = \\frac{156b + 156c}{bc - 156}$ . Substituting and cancelling into our equation,\n\n$b+c = 2\\frac{156b+156c}{bc-156}$ .\n\nMultiplying, $(b+c)(bc-156) = 2 \\times 156(b+c).$\n\nSo, $(bc-156)$ = 312. Our answer is 312 + 156 = $\\boxed{468}$ .\n\n~aleyang\n\nSolution 10:\nWe know by Euler's theorem $OI^2=R^2-2Rr.$ Since $AO=R,$ we have $AI=\\sqrt{2Rr}.$ Now, extend $AI$ to meet $BC$ at $A'$ and the circumcircle of $\\Delta ABC$ at $L.$ By the Incenter-Excenter lemma, $BL=CL=IL=r_a.$ (Note that $OI \\perp AL \\rightarrow AI=IL=r_a\\rightarrow r_a=\\sqrt{2Rr}.$ ) Using Ptolemy in the cyclic quadrilateral $ABLC,$ we have $c\\cdot r_a+b\\cdot r_a=2r_a\\cdot a \\iff \\frac{b+c}{a}=2.$ Also using the angle-bisector theorem we get, $\\frac{c}{A'B}=\\frac{b}{A'C}=\\frac{b+c}{a}=2,$ so call $c=2m, b=2n, A'B=m, A'C=n.$ Since $\\Delta AA'B \\sim \\Delta CA'L,$ $\\frac{AB}{r_a}=\\frac{A'B}{A'L}\\rightarrow LA'=\\frac{r_a}{2}.$ Thus, $AA'=\\frac{3r_a}{2}$ (as $AL=2r_a$ ), and $mn=AA'\\cdot LA'=\\frac{3r_a^2}{4}=\\frac{3Rr}{2}.$ In this problem, we want to find $4mn=6Rr,$ yielding an answer of $\\boxed{468}.$\n\n~anduran"}

We assume $a + b + c = 300$ , $ab + bc + ca = m$ , and $abc = n$ .

There are 201 solutions for each of $a=0$ , $b=0$ and $c=0$ , and subtract the overcounting of 2 for solution $(200, 200, 200)$ , the final result is $201 \\times 3 - 2 = \\boxed{601}$ .\n\n~Dan Li\n\nSolution 6:\nSince $a + b + c = 300$ , $(100 - a) + (100 - b) + (100 - c) = 300 - (a + b + c) = 0$ . There is a well known algebraic identity:\n\nIf $a + b + c = 0, a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$ .

This means that $300^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc + 3 * 6 * 10^6$ .\nSimplify to get $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 6abc = 9 * 10^6$ .\nThis means that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 9 * 10^6 - 6abc$ .\n\nWe know that $a + b + c = 300$ . We also know that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac) = 300^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac)$ .\n\nNow the LHS can be written as $3 * 100^3 - 3 * 100^2 * 300 + 3 * 100 * (300^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc)) - (9 * 10^6 - 6abc)$ . This simplifies to $12 * 10^6 - 600(ab + bc + ac) + 6abc$ .\n\nNow, we evaluate the right side. $(100 - a)(100 - b)(100 - c) = 10^6 - 10^4(a + b + c) + 100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = -2*10^6 - 100(ab + bc + ac) - abc$ . Now we set the LHS and RHS equal to each other.\n\n\\[12 * 10^6 - 600(ab + ac + bc) + 6abc = -2*10^6 + 100(ab + bc + ac) - abc\\] . Notice that the LHS is just $-6$ times the RHS. If the RHS is equal to $-6$ times itself, the only possible value the RHS can take is $0$ . The RHS was originally $3(100 - a)(100 - b)(100 - c)$ . This must equal $0$ . \\[3(100 - a)(100 - b)(100 - c) = 0\\] . This means one of $a, b,$ or $c$ must be $100$ . The remaining two must sum up to $200$ as the three of them together sum to $300$ as indicated by the problem. WLOG Let us assume $a = 100$ and $b + c = 200$ . As $b$ and $c$ are nonnegative integers, we employ Stars and Bars to find that there are $\\binom{200 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = 201$ solutions to the equation. As $a, b,$ or $c$ could in reality be $100$ , multiply $201$ by $3$ to get $603$ . However, the solution $(a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100)$ is counted thrice in total, but we only want it counted once, so subtract $2$ from $603$ to arrive at the final answer : The number of solutions is $\\boxed{601}$ ."}

Let $P$ be located at $(a,0)$ and $Q$ be located at $(0,b)$ . With these assumptions, we may arrive at the equation $ay +bx =ab$ . However, a critical condition that must be satisfied by our parameters is that $a^2+b^2=1$ , since the length of $\\overline{PQ}=1$ .\n\nHere's the golden trick that resolves the problem: we wish to find some point $C$ along $\\overline{AB}$ such that $\\overline{PQ}$ passes through $C$ if and only if $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ . It's not hard to convince oneself of this, since the property $a^2+b^2=1$ implies that if $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ , then $\\overline{PQ}=\\overline{AB}$ .\n\nWe should now try to relate the point $C$ to some value of $a$ . This is accomplished by finding the intersection of two lines: \\[     a\\left(-\\sqrt{3}x +\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) + x\\sqrt{1-a^2} = a\\sqrt{1-a^2} \\]\n\nWhere we have also used the fact that $b=\\sqrt{1-a^2}$ , which follows nicely from $a^2+b^2 =1$ . \\[     a\\left(-\\sqrt{3}x +\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)   = (a-x)\\sqrt{1-a^2} \\]\n\nSquare both sides and go through some algebraic manipulations to arrive at \\[     -a^4 +2xa^3+\\left(-4x^2+3x+\\frac{1}{4}\\right)a^2-2xa+x^2=0 \\]\n\nNote how $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ is a solution to this polynomial, and it is logically so. If we found the set of intersections consisting of line segment $\\overline{AB}$ with an identical copy of itself, every single point on the line (all $x$ values) should satisfy the equation. Thus, we can perform polynomial division to eliminate the extraneous solution $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ . \\[     -a^3 + \\left(2x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)a^2+(-4x^2+4x)a-2x^2=0 \\]\n\nRemember our original goal. It was to find an $x$ value such that $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ is the only valid solution. Therefore, we can actually plug in $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ back into the equation to look for values of $x$ such that the relation is satisfied, then eliminate undesirable answers. \\[     16x^2-10x+1=0 \\] This is easily factored, allowing us to determine that $x=\\frac{1}{8},\\frac{1}{2}$ . The latter root is not our answer, since on line $\\overline{AB}$ , $y\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=0$ , the horizontal line segment running from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$ covers that point. From this, we see that $x=\\frac{1}{8}$ is the only possible candidate.\n\nGoing back to line $\\overline{AB}, y= -\\sqrt{3}x+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ , plugging in $x=\\frac{1}{8}$ yields $y=\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}$ . The distance from the origin is then given by $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{8^2}+\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)^2} =\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{16}}$ . That number squared is $\\frac{7}{16}$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{023}$ .\n\n~Installhelp_hex\n\nWhy this works: Assume the quartic equation has exactly two real roots. Then for $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ to be the only solution, it must be a doubled root. Thus, even after dividing the quartic by $a-\\frac{1}{2}$ , $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ is still a root.\n~inaccessibles\n\nOther explanation: Clearly $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ works because then PQ = AB. Thus, we can factor out $a-\\frac{1}{2}$ .\n\nFrom the 3rd degree polynomial, it must either have 3 real roots, or 1 real root and 2 non real roots, because it has real coefficients.\n\nSo it must have atleast 1 real root. If this root wasn't $\\frac{1}{2}$ this would mean their is another line PQ that satisfies the equation. Thus, their must be another root at $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ and plugging in, we can solve for $x$ .\n~Bigbrain_2009\n\nSolution 2:\n$y=-(\\tan \\theta) x+\\sin \\theta=-\\sqrt{3}x+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-2\\sin \\theta}{2\\sqrt{3}-2\\tan \\theta}$\n\nNow, we want to find $\\lim_{\\theta\\to\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-2\\sin \\theta}{2\\sqrt{3}-2\\tan \\theta}$ .

Pick points $A_2$ and $B_2$ on $CA_1$ and $CB$ such that $CA_2 = CA$ , $CB_2 = CB_1$ , we have $A_1A_2 = BB_2$ .

The number of solutions for $k = \\tan 30^\\circ$ and $\\tan 60^\\circ$ are the same.\n\nConsider $k = 0$ .\nWe need to find a pair of horizontal segments and a pair of vertical segments to form a rectangle.\n\nFor $k = 0$ , the length of each horizontal segment can only be 0, 2, 4.\n\nDenote by $2i$ the shorter length of two parallel horizontal segments.\nGiven $i$ , the number of pairs of two parallel horizontal segments is $1 + 2 \\left( 4 - 2 i \\right)$ .\n\nGiven $i$ , to form a rectangle, the number of pairs of vertical segments is $\\binom{2i + 2}{2}$ .\n\nTherefore, for $k = 0$ , the number of rectangles is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i=0}^2 \\left( 1 + 2 \\left( 4 - 2 i \\right) \\right)\n\\binom{2i + 2}{2}\n& = 54 .\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe number of rectangles for $k = \\tan 30^\\circ$ and $\\tan 60^\\circ$ are the same.\nTherefore, the total number of rectangles in this case is $54 \\cdot 3 = 162$ .\n\nCase 2: $k = \\tan 15^\\circ$ , $\\tan 45^\\circ$ , $\\tan 75^\\circ$ .\n\nThe number of rectangles under all these $k$ s are the same.\nSo we only count for $k = \\tan 15^\\circ$ .\n\nFor $k = \\tan 15^\\circ$ , the length of each segment can only be 1, 3, 5.\nHowever, there is only one segment with length 5.\nSo this cannot be the shorter length of two parallel segments with slope $\\tan 15^\\circ$ .\n\nDenote by $2i + 1$ the shorter length of two parallel segments with slope $\\tan 15^\\circ$ .\nGiven $i$ , the number of pairs of two parallel segments is $1 + 2 \\left( 3 - 2 i \\right)$ .\n\nGiven $i$ , to form a rectangle, the number of pairs of vertical segments is $\\binom{2i + 3}{2}$ .\n\nTherefore, for $k = \\tan 15^\\circ$ , the number of rectangles is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i=0}^1 \\left( 1 + 2 \\left( 3 - 2 i \\right) \\right)\n\\binom{2i + 3}{2}\n& = 51 .\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe number of rectangles for $k = \\tan 45^\\circ$ and $\\tan 75^\\circ$ are the same.\nTherefore, the total number of rectangles in this case is $51 \\cdot 3 = 153$ .\n\nPutting all cases together, the total number of rectangles is $162 + 153 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(315) }}$ .\n\n~Steven Chen and SHEN KISLAY KAI(Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)"}
