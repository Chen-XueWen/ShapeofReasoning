Find $m+n.$", "model": "deepseek-r1:70b", "seed": 42, "temperature": 0.0, "trace": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this geometry problem here about an isosceles triangle ABC where AB equals AC. Points D and E are on sides AC and AB respectively, with some equal lengths given: AE = ED = DB = BC. The goal is to find the measure of angle ABC in degrees, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize this triangle. Since AB equals AC, triangle ABC is isosceles with vertex at A. So angles at B and C are equal? Wait, no, actually in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. If AB = AC, then BC is the base, so angles at B and C should be equal. Hmm, but wait, angle ABC is one of them, which we need to find.\n\nNow, points D and E are on sides AC and AB respectively. Specifically, D lies strictly between A and C on AC, meaning it's somewhere closer to A than to C? Or could be anywhere in between except the endpoints. Similarly, E is strictly between A and B on AB.\n\nGiven that AE = ED = DB = BC. So four segments are equal: AE, ED, DB, and BC. That seems like a chain of equal lengths from A through E, D, then to B, and also BC is equal in length to these.\n\nLet me try to draw this triangle ABC with AB=AC. Let's denote point A at the top, B at the bottom left, C at the bottom right. So AC is the right side, AB is the left side.\n\nPoint E is on AB somewhere between A and B. Point D is on AC somewhere between A and C. Now, AE = ED = DB = BC.\n\nSo starting from point A, moving along AB to E, then from E to D (but wait, D is on AC). So ED connects E on AB to D on AC. Then from D to B? Wait, no: the segments are AE, ED, DB, and BC. So it's a path from A to E to D to B, each segment equal in length.\n\nSo starting at A, go along AB to E, then from E draw a segment ED to point D on AC, then from D go to B via DB, which is another equal segment. Also, BC is equal to these segments.\n\nHmm, that seems like four equal-length segments: AE = ED = DB = BC.\n\nSo perhaps if I denote the length of each as x, so AE = x, ED = x, DB = x, and BC = x.\n\nGiven that AB = AC, let's denote AB = AC = c. Then, since E is on AB such that AE = x, then EB would be AB - AE = c - x.\n\nSimilarly, D is on AC such that AD = AE + ED? Wait no: from A to E is along AB, and from E to D is a segment inside the triangle. So actually, point D isn't necessarily at a distance of 2x from A because it's not along AC; rather, it's somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe I should assign coordinates to this figure to make things clearer.\n\nLet me place point A at (0, h), and since AB = AC, let me set points B and C symmetrically. Let’s say point B is at (-k, 0) and point C is at (k, 0). So the base BC is from (-k, 0) to (k, 0), so its length is 2k.\n\nGiven that AB = AC, which would be true because of the symmetry. The coordinates make sense for an isosceles triangle with vertex A above the origin.\n\nNow, point E is on AB somewhere between A and B. Let me parameterize AB: from (0, h) to (-k, 0). So any point on AB can be expressed as a linear combination of these two points.\n\nSimilarly, point D is on AC, which goes from (0, h) to (k, 0).\n\nGiven that AE = ED = DB = BC. Let's denote each of these lengths as x. So:\n\n1. AE = x\n2. ED = x\n3. DB = x\n4. BC = x\n\nBut wait, BC is the base of the triangle, which we've set to have length 2k. Therefore, 2k = x.\n\nSo BC = x implies that 2k = x. So k = x/2.\n\nNow, let's find coordinates for points E and D such that AE = ED = DB = x.\n\nFirst, point E is on AB. Let me parameterize AB: from A(0, h) to B(-k, 0). The vector from A to B is (-k, -h). So any point E can be expressed as A + t*(vector AB), where t is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo coordinates of E would be (0 - kt, h - ht) = (-kt, h(1 - t)).\n\nSimilarly, the length AE is x. The distance from A to E is sqrt[ (kt)^2 + (ht)^2 ] = t * sqrt(k^2 + h^2). Since AB has length c = sqrt(k^2 + h^2), so AE = t*c = x. Therefore, t = x / c.\n\nSo coordinates of E are (-k*(x/c), h*(1 - x/c)).\n\nSimilarly, point D is on AC. Let me parameterize AC: from A(0, h) to C(k, 0). The vector is (k, -h). So any point D can be expressed as A + s*(vector AC), where s is between 0 and 1.\n\nSo coordinates of D would be (sk, h - sh).\n\nNow, the distance from E to D should also be x. Let's compute ED:\n\nCoordinates of E: (-kx/c, h(1 - x/c))\nCoordinates of D: (sk, h(1 - s))\n\nDistance ED squared is [sk - (-kx/c)]^2 + [h(1 - s) - h(1 - x/c)]^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst component: sk + kx/c = k(s + x/c)\nSecond component: h(1 - s - 1 + x/c) = h(x/c - s)\n\nSo squared distance ED² is [k(s + x/c)]² + [h(x/c - s)]² = (k²)(s + x/c)^2 + (h²)(x/c - s)^2.\n\nSince ED = x, so ED² = x². Therefore:\n\n(k²)(s + x/c)^2 + (h²)(x/c - s)^2 = x².\n\nLet me note that c² = k² + h² because AB has length sqrt(k² + h²) = c.\n\nSo perhaps we can express everything in terms of c, k, and h. But this might get complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since DB is also equal to x, let's compute the distance from D to B.\n\nCoordinates of D: (sk, h(1 - s))\nCoordinates of B: (-k, 0)\n\nDistance DB squared:\n\n(sk + k)^2 + [h(1 - s) - 0]^2 = [k(s + 1)]² + [h(1 - s)]²\n\nWhich is k²(s + 1)^2 + h²(1 - s)^2.\n\nSince DB = x, so this equals x²:\n\nk²(s + 1)^2 + h²(1 - s)^2 = x².\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. (k²)(s + x/c)^2 + (h²)(x/c - s)^2 = x²\n2. k²(s + 1)^2 + h²(1 - s)^2 = x²\n\nAnd also, from BC: 2k = x => k = x/2.\n\nSo let's substitute k = x/2 into these equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n(k²)(s + x/c)^2 + (h²)(x/c - s)^2 = x²\n=> (x²/4)(s + x/c)^2 + h²(x/c - s)^2 = x²\n\nSecond equation:\n\nk²(s + 1)^2 + h²(1 - s)^2 = x²\n=> (x²/4)(s + 1)^2 + h²(1 - s)^2 = x²\n\nAlso, since c² = k² + h², and k = x/2:\n\nc² = (x²)/4 + h² => h² = c² - x²/4.\n\nSo we can express everything in terms of c and x. Let me substitute h² into the equations.\n\nFirst equation becomes:\n\n(x²/4)(s + x/c)^2 + (c² - x²/4)(x/c - s)^2 = x²\n\nSecond equation becomes:\n\n(x²/4)(s + 1)^2 + (c² - x²/4)(1 - s)^2 = x²\n\nThese are two equations with variables s and c. Hmm, seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe we can find a relationship between s and the other variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using triangle properties instead of coordinates would be better.\n\nGiven that ABC is isosceles with AB=AC, let me denote angle at A as α, so angles at B and C are equal, each being (180 - α)/2 degrees.\n\nWe need to find angle ABC, which is one of the base angles, so it's (180 - α)/2. So if we can find alpha, then we can compute angle ABC.\n\nGiven that AE = ED = DB = BC = x.\n\nLet me try to express some lengths in terms of sides and angles.\n\nFirst, AB = AC = c, as before.\n\nFrom point A, moving along AB a distance x to E, so AE = x. Then from E, moving to D on AC such that ED = x. From D, moving to B with DB = x. Also, BC = x.\n\nSo starting at A, we have points E and D such that the path A-E-D-B is connected by equal segments of length x.\n\nGiven this setup, perhaps triangles AED and EDB are equilateral? Wait, not necessarily because angles aren't specified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangles here.\n\nLet me consider triangle AEB. Hmm, but I don't know much about it yet.\n\nWait, let's look at triangle AED: points A, E, D.\n\nWe have AE = ED = x. So triangle AED is isoceles with sides AE = ED.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle EDB, we have ED = DB = x, so that's also an isoceles triangle.\n\nPerhaps I can find some angles here.\n\nLet me denote angle at E in triangle AED as theta. Then the base angles would be equal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates again but with specific values for simplicity.\n\nSince AB=AC=c and BC=x (since BC = x), let me set c such that calculations are easier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vectors or trigonometry.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let’s denote angle BAC as α, so angles at B and C are both β = (180 - α)/2 degrees.\n\nGiven ABC is isoceles with AB=AC=c, BC=x.\n\nFrom point A, we have AE = x on AB, so E divides AB into segments AE = x and EB = c - x.\n\nSimilarly, from E, moving to D on AC such that ED = x. Then from D to B is another segment of length x.\n\nSo starting at A, going along AB a distance x to E, then from E cutting across the triangle to D on AC with ED=x, then from D to B with DB=x.\n\nThis seems like a four-bar linkage or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry again but assigning specific values for c and x.\n\nWait, perhaps setting BC = 1 unit. Then x=1, so k = x/2 = 0.5.\n\nSo in that case, points B(-0.5, 0) and C(0.5, 0). AB and AC both have length c.\n\nThen h can be found from c² = (0.5)^2 + h² => h = sqrt(c² - 0.25).\n\nNow, point E is on AB such that AE=1. So the distance from A to E is 1.\n\nCoordinates of E: moving along AB from A(0,h) towards B(-0.5,0). The vector AB is (-0.5, -h), so unit vector in direction AB is (-0.5/c, -h/c).\n\nTherefore, point E is at (0 + (-0.5/c)*1, h + (-h/c)*1 ) = (-0.5/c, h(1 - 1/c)).\n\nSimilarly, point D is on AC such that ED=1 and DB=1.\n\nSo coordinates of D: moving along AC from A(0,h) towards C(0.5,0). The vector AC is (0.5, -h), so unit vector in direction AC is (0.5/c, -h/c).\n\nLet me denote the parameter for point D as s, so D = (0 + 0.5s, h - hs) = (0.5s, h(1 - s)).\n\nNow, distance from E to D should be 1:\n\nsqrt[ (0.5s - (-0.5/c))^2 + (h(1 - s) - h(1 - 1/c))^2 ] = 1\n\nSimplify inside the sqrt:\n\nFirst component: 0.5s + 0.5/c\nSecond component: h(1 - s - 1 + 1/c ) = h(1/c - s)\n\nSo squared distance:\n\n[0.5(s + 1/c)]² + [h(1/c - s)]² = 1\n\nSimilarly, the distance from D to B is 1:\n\nsqrt[ (0.5s - (-0.5))^2 + (h(1 - s) - 0)^2 ] = 1\n\nSimplify inside sqrt:\n\nFirst component: 0.5s + 0.5\nSecond component: h(1 - s)\n\nSo squared distance:\n\n[0.5(s + 1)]² + [h(1 - s)]² = 1\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. [0.25(s + 1/c)^2] + [h^2 (1/c - s)^2 ] = 1\n2. [0.25(s + 1)^2] + [h^2(1 - s)^2 ] = 1\n\nAlso, we know that c² = (0.5)^2 + h² => c² = 0.25 + h².\n\nSo let me write down these equations:\n\nEquation 1: 0.25(s + 1/c)^2 + h²(1/c - s)^2 = 1\n\nEquation 2: 0.25(s + 1)^2 + h²(1 - s)^2 = 1\n\nAnd c² = 0.25 + h² => h² = c² - 0.25.\n\nLet me substitute h² into both equations:\n\nEquation 1 becomes:\n0.25(s + 1/c)^2 + (c² - 0.25)(1/c - s)^2 = 1\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n0.25(s + 1)^2 + (c² - 0.25)(1 - s)^2 = 1\n\nNow, let me denote c as a variable and try to solve for s.\n\nThis seems quite involved algebraically. Maybe I can subtract the two equations or find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assuming specific values might help? For example, if angle ABC is 100 degrees, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe it's a common angle like 60 degrees, but in an isoceles triangle with such points, probably not.\n\nWait, let me think about the structure again. Since AE = ED = DB = BC, and starting from A, moving along AB to E, then across to D on AC, then to B, each segment equal. So it's like a polygonal path inside the triangle with four equal sides.\n\nGiven that ABC is isoceles, perhaps there are some symmetries or similar triangles we can exploit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities in triangle AED and EDB.\n\nWait, let me consider triangle AEB: points A, E, B. We know AE = x, EB = c - x, AB = c.\n\nSimilarly, triangle AED has sides AE = ED = x, so it's an isoceles triangle with apex at E.\n\nBut without knowing the angles, maybe hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vectors for points E and D.\n\nWait, another idea: since we have multiple equal lengths, maybe some triangles are congruent or similar.\n\nGiven that ED = DB = BC, which is x. So from point D, moving distance x gets us to B, and then from B, moving distance x along BC gets us to C.\n\nBut wait, BC is length x as well? Wait no: earlier I set BC = 2k, but in the coordinate system where k = x/2, so BC = x. So yes, BC is also of length x.\n\nSo starting at D, moving x units gets you to B, and from B, moving another x along BC gets you to C.\n\nBut point D is on AC, which has total length c. So the distance from A to D plus distance from D to C equals c. But we don't know where exactly D is located.\n\nWait, perhaps using mass point geometry or coordinate geometry would be better here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using complex numbers for coordinates.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nSet point A at 0 in the complex plane (for simplicity), with AB along the real axis? Wait no, because ABC is isoceles with AB=AC. Maybe set A at (0, h) as before, but perhaps it's better to use a different coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, place point B at (-1, 0), C at (1, 0), so BC = 2 units. Then AB and AC would be equal, each of length sqrt(1 + h²). So in this case, x = BC = 2? Wait no, earlier I set BC=x=1.\n\nWait, perhaps scaling the figure for simplicity.\n\nLet me define BC as 2 units, so k=1, then points B(-1,0), C(1,0). Then AB and AC have length c = sqrt(1 + h²).\n\nThen AE = ED = DB = BC/2? Wait no, in this case, if BC is 2, then x would be 2 as well. But earlier I set BC=x=1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to let BC = x, so scaling accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using barycentric coordinates or something else.\n\nThis seems getting too complicated.

Find $m + n$ .", "model": "deepseek-r1:70b", "seed": 42, "temperature": 0.0, "trace": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about logarithms forming a geometric progression. Let me try to unpack it step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says there's a unique positive real number x such that log base 8 of (2x), log base 4 of x, and log base 2 of x form a geometric progression with a positive common ratio. I need to find x expressed as m/n where m and n are coprime, then compute m + n.\n\nAlright, let's recall what a geometric progression is. It means each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, r. So if we have three terms a, b, c in GP, then b/a = c/b, which implies that b² = a*c.\n\nIn this problem, the three terms are log_8(2x), log_4(x), and log_2(x). Let me denote them as A, B, C for simplicity. So,\n\nA = log_8(2x)\nB = log_4(x)\nC = log_2(x)\n\nSince they form a GP with positive common ratio, we have that B/A = C/B, so B² = A*C.\n\nNow, I need to express all these logarithms in terms of the same base or relate them somehow. Maybe converting them all to base 2 would help because 8, 4, and 2 are powers of 2.\n\nLet me recall the change of base formula: log_b(a) = log_c(a)/log_c(b). So I can convert A, B, C to base 2.\n\nStarting with A:\n\nA = log_8(2x) = (log_2(2x)) / (log_2(8)). Since log_2(8) is 3 because 2^3=8. And log_2(2x) is log_2(2) + log_2(x) which is 1 + log_2(x). So,\n\nA = (1 + log_2(x)) / 3.\n\nSimilarly, B:\n\nB = log_4(x) = (log_2(x)) / (log_2(4)). Since log_2(4)=2. Therefore,\n\nB = (log_2(x))/2.\n\nAnd C is already in base 2:\n\nC = log_2(x).\n\nSo now I have A, B, and C expressed in terms of log_2(x). Let me denote y = log_2(x) for simplicity. Then,\n\nA = (1 + y)/3,\nB = y/2,\nC = y.\n\nNow, since they form a GP, we have that B² = A*C. So let's write that equation:\n\n(B)^2 = A * C\n\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of y:\n\n(y/2)² = [(1 + y)/3] * [y]\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: (y²)/4\nRight side: [(1 + y)y]/3 = (y + y²)/3\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n(y²)/4 = (y + y²)/3\n\nLet me multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators. 12 is the least common multiple of 4 and 3.\n\n12*(y²/4) = 12*((y + y²)/3)\n\nSimplify each side:\n\nLeft: 3*y²\nRight: 4*(y + y²) = 4y + 4y²\n\nSo, equation is now:\n\n3y² = 4y + 4y²\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n3y² - 4y - 4y² = 0 => (-y² - 4y) = 0 => Multiply both sides by -1: y² + 4y = 0.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check my steps again because I might have made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nStarting from:\n\n3y² = 4y + 4y²\n\nSubtract 3y² from both sides:\n\n0 = 4y + y² => y² + 4y = 0\n\nSo, factoring:\n\ny(y + 4) = 0\n\nThus, solutions are y=0 or y=-4.\n\nBut wait, let's think about this. Remember that y = log_2(x). Since x is a positive real number, log_2(x) can be any real number, but in our case, the original logarithms must be defined.\n\nLooking back at A: log_8(2x), which requires 2x > 0, so x>0. Similarly for B and C, x>0 is sufficient because they are logs of positive numbers.\n\nBut let's consider y=0: that would mean log_2(x)=0 => x=1.\n\nIf x=1, then A = log_8(2*1) = log_8(2). Since 8^(1/3)=2, so log_8(2)=1/3. B=log_4(1)=0 because any log base to 1 is zero. C=log_2(1)=0.\n\nSo the terms would be (1/3), 0, 0. But a geometric progression with common ratio r must have each term multiplied by r. However, if one of the middle terms is zero, then all subsequent terms should also be zero, but here A=1/3, B=0, C=0. So that would mean starting from A=1/3, multiplying by r to get 0, which implies r=0, but then the next term after 0 would have to be 0*r=0, which is consistent. However, in a geometric progression with positive common ratio, as per the problem statement, r must be positive. But if r=0, it's not positive. So y=0 leads to x=1, but that gives us a GP with r=0, which isn't allowed because the common ratio has to be positive.\n\nTherefore, we discard y=0 and consider the other solution: y=-4.\n\nSo y = -4 => log_2(x) = -4. Therefore, x = 2^(-4) = 1/16.\n\nWait a second, let me verify if this works because sometimes when dealing with logarithms and geometric progressions, especially with negative terms or ratios, things can get tricky.\n\nSo x=1/16. Let's compute A, B, C:\n\nA = log_8(2x) = log_8(2*(1/16)) = log_8(1/8). Since 8^(-1)=1/8, so log_8(1/8)=-1.\n\nB=log_4(x)=log_4(1/16). Since 4^(-2)=1/16, so B=-2.\n\nC=log_2(x)=log_2(1/16)= -4. Because 2^(-4)=1/16.\n\nSo the three terms are A=-1, B=-2, C=-4.\n\nWait, but in a geometric progression with positive common ratio, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous one by r>0. So let's check if these form a GP:\n\nFrom A to B: -1 * r = -2 => r= (-2)/(-1)=2\n\nFrom B to C: -2 * r = -4 => r= (-4)/(-2)=2.\n\nSo yes, the common ratio is 2, which is positive. So that works.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier step when I set up y=-4, x=1/16, and then computed A, B, C as -1, -2, -4, which are negative numbers but with a positive common ratio of 2. The problem says the GP has positive common ratio, so that's acceptable because even though the terms themselves are negative, the ratio is positive.\n\nBut let me double-check if I made any mistake in setting up the equation earlier.\n\nWe had:\n\n(y/2)^2 = [(1 + y)/3] * [y]\n\nWhich led to (y²)/4 = (y + y²)/3\n\nMultiplying both sides by 12: 3y² = 4y + 4y² => 0= y² +4y.\n\nSo solutions at y=0 and y=-4. We saw that y=0 leads to a GP with r=0, which is invalid because the problem specifies positive common ratio. So only y=-4 is valid, leading to x=1/16.\n\nWait, but 1/16 can be written as m/n where m=1 and n=16, so m +n=17.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistake in the algebra steps because sometimes when dealing with quadratics, especially after substitution, it's easy to make an error.\n\nLet me re-express A, B, C correctly:\n\nA = log_8(2x) = (log_2(2x))/3 = [1 + log_2(x)]/3\n\nB = log_4(x) = (log_2 x)/2\n\nC = log_2 x.\n\nSo when I set up the equation B² = A*C, substituting:\n\n(y/2)^2 = [(1+y)/3] * y => y²/4 = y(1 + y)/3.\n\nMultiply both sides by 12: 3y² = 4y(1 + y) => 3y²=4y+4y²\n\nBring all terms to left: 3y² -4y -4y²=0 => (-y² -4y)=0 => Multiply by -1: y² +4y=0.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So the solutions are y=0 and y=-4.\n\nAs before, only y=-4 is valid because it gives a positive common ratio of 2.\n\nTherefore, x=2^(-4)=1/16, so m=1, n=16, which are coprime, so m +n=17.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possibilities correctly. For example, when dealing with logarithms and geometric progressions, sometimes the terms can be in different orders or signs might affect things, but in this case, since we have a positive common ratio, even though the terms are negative, it's acceptable because each term is obtained by multiplying the previous one by r=2.\n\nSo I think that's correct. Therefore, x=1/16, so m +n=17.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the three logarithms \\(\\log_8(2x)\\), \\(\\log_4(x)\\), and \\(\\log_2(x)\\) form a geometric progression (GP) with a positive common ratio. Denote these terms as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) respectively:\n\n\\[\nA = \\log_8(2x), \\quad B = \\log_4(x), \\quad C = \\log_2(x)\n\\]\n\nSince they form a GP, we have the relationship \\(B^2 = A \\cdot C\\). To simplify the logarithms, we convert them to base 2 using the change of base formula:\n\n1. For \\(A = \\log_8(2x)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\log_8(2x) = \\frac{\\log_2(2x)}{\\log_2(8)} = \\frac{1 + \\log_2(x)}{3}\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\(A = \\frac{1 + y}{3}\\), where \\(y = \\log_2(x)\\).\n\n2. For \\(B = \\log_4(x)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\log_4(x) = \\frac{\\log_2(x)}{\\log_2(4)} = \\frac{y}{2}\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\(B = \\frac{y}{2}\\).\n\n3. For \\(C = \\log_2(x)\\), we already have \\(C = y\\).\n\nSubstituting these into the GP condition \\(B^2 = A \\cdot C\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1 + y}{3}\\right) \\cdot y\n\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y^2}{4} = \\frac{(1 + y)y}{3}\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 12 to clear the denominators:\n\n\\[\n3y^2 = 4(1 + y)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging terms:\n\n\\[\n3y^2 - 4y - 4y^2 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -y^2 - 4y = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\ny(y + 4) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions: \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = -4\\). Since \\(y = \\log_2(x)\\), we analyze each case:\n\n1. If \\(y = 0\\), then \\(\\log_2(x) = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 1\\). However, substituting \\(x = 1\\) into the original logarithms results in a GP with terms \\((1/3, 0, 0)\\), which has a common ratio of 0. This violates the condition that the common ratio must be positive.\n\n2. If \\(y = -4\\), then \\(\\log_2(x) = -4 \\Rightarrow x = 2^{-4} = \\frac{1}{16}\\). Substituting \\(x = \\frac{1}{16}\\) into the original logarithms gives:\n\n   - \\(A = \\log_8(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{16}) = \\log_8(\\frac{1}{8}) = -1\\)\n   - \\(B = \\log_4(\\frac{1}{16}) = -2\\)\n   - \\(C = \\log_2(\\frac{1}{16}) = -4\\)\n\n   These terms form a GP with a common ratio of 2, which is positive as required.\n\nThus, the unique solution is \\(x = \\frac{1}{16}\\). Expressing \\(x\\) as \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, we have \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = 16\\). Therefore, \\(m + n = 1 + 16 = 17\\).\n\nFinal Answer: 17", "timestamp": 1759639222, "given_answer": "017", "pred_answer": "17", "reference_solution": "Solution 1:\nSince these form a geometric series, $\\frac{\\log_2{x}}{\\log_4{x}}$ is the common ratio.

If we let $y$ be the exponent of $\\log_8 (2x)$ , then we have $8^y=2x;\\:4^{2y}=x;\\:2^{4y}=x.$ Wee can then divide the first equation by two to have the right side be $x$ .

Hence $\\log_2x = -4$ and $x = \\frac{1}{16}$ . The requested sum is $1+16 = 17$ .\n\nSolution 9:\nLet the series be $a,ar,ar^2$ . So, converting these logarithms into exponents we have $8^a = 2x$ , $4^{ar} = x$ , and $2^{ar^2} = x$ . So, setting the 2nd and 3rd equations equal, we have: \\[4^{ar} = 2^{ar^2} \\Longrightarrow 2^{2ar} = 2^{ar^2} \\Longrightarrow 2ar = ar^2 \\Longrightarrow r = 2\\] . Plugging that into our 3rd equation, we have $2^{4a} = x$ . We recall that $8^a = 2x \\Longrightarrow 2^{3a} = 2x$ . So, since $2^{4a} = x$ , $2x = 2^{4a+1}$ . Now, setting $2^{3a}$ , and $2^{4a+1}$ equal, we get $a = -1$ , so plugging into our first equation, we have \\[\\dfrac{1}{8} = 2x \\Longrightarrow x = \\dfrac{1}{16} \\Longrightarrow \\boxed{017}\\]\n\n-jb2015007"}
