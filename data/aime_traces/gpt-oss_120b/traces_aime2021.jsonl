First race: Zou wins with probability 1 (given). Then for each subsequent race i (2..6), probability Zou wins depends on whether he won previous race: if previous win, P(win)=2/3; if previous loss, P(win)=1/3. Similarly probability of loss is complementary.\n\nWe need probability that total wins =5. Since first race is win, we need exactly 4 more wins among races 2-6, with total wins 5. So among races 2-6, there are 5 races, need exactly 4 wins and 1 loss. Also the sequence probabilities depend on adjacency.\n\nWe need to sum probability over all sequences of length 5 (races 2-6) with exactly one L and four W, given initial state W at race1. Compute probability of each sequence using transition probabilities.\n\nLet’s denote sequence of outcomes for races 2-6: e.g., W W W W L etc. Need exactly one L.\n\nWe can treat as a Markov chain with transition probabilities: P(W|W)=2/3, P(L|W)=1/3; P(W|L)=1/3, P(L|L)=2/3.\n\nGiven start state W (race1). For a given sequence s2...s6, probability = product over i=2..6 of P(s_i | s_{i-1}).\n\nWe need sum over all sequences with exactly one L.\n\nLet's enumerate positions of the single loss among races 2-6. Let loss occur at position k (k from 2 to 6). Then sequence: before k, all wins; at k, loss; after k, all wins (since only one loss). So pattern: W...W L W...W.\n\nWe need to compute probability for each k.\n\nLet’s denote number of wins before loss: a = k-2 (since race2 is first after race1). So a wins preceding loss. After loss, there are b = 6 - k wins after loss (since total races after loss are wins). So a+b = 4 (since total wins among races2-6 =4). Indeed.\n\nNow compute probability:\n\nStart with race1 = W.\n\nFor i=2 to k-1 (a wins): each transition from previous win to win: probability (2/3) each. So factor (2/3)^a.\n\nTransition from race k-1 (which is W) to race k (L): probability P(L|W)=1/3.\n\nNow after loss, we have b wins. Transition from loss to win: P(W|L)=1/3 for first win after loss (race k+1). Then subsequent wins are from previous win to win: each (2/3). So total factor after loss: (1/3)*(2/3)^{b-1} if b>=1. If b=0 (loss at last race), then no further factor.\n\nThus overall probability for given k:\n\nP_k = (2/3)^a * (1/3) * [if b>0 then (1/3)*(2/3)^{b-1} else 1].\n\nSimplify: For b>=1: P_k = (2/3)^a * (1/3) * (1/3)*(2/3)^{b-1} = (2/3)^{a+b-1} * (1/3)^2 = (2/3)^{(4)-1} * (1/9) = (2/3)^3 * 1/9 = (8/27)*(1/9)=8/243.\n\nCheck: a+b =4, so exponent 3 indeed.\n\nFor b=0 (loss at race6): then a=4, b=0. Probability: (2/3)^4 * (1/3) (since transition to loss) = (16/81)*(1/3)=16/243.\n\nSimilarly, if loss at race2 (k=2): then a=0, b=4. Need probability: start from race1 W to race2 L: (1/3). Then after loss, we have 4 wins: first win after loss probability (1/3), then three more wins each (2/3). So probability = (1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3)^3 = (1/9)*(8/27)=8/243. That's same as general case b>=1.\n\nThus only special case is loss at last race (k=6) where after loss there are no wins, giving probability 16/243.\n\nSimilarly, loss at race5? Let's compute: k=5 => a=3, b=1. Using formula for b>=1: (2/3)^3 * (1/3)*(1/3)*(2/3)^{0}= (8/27)*(1/9)=8/243. Good.\n\nThus for loss positions 2-5, probability each = 8/243. For loss at position 6, probability = 16/243.\n\nNow total probability = 4*(8/243) + 16/243 = (32+16)/243 = 48/243 = simplify divide by 3: 16/81.\n\nThus probability = 16/81. So m=16, n=81, relatively prime? gcd=1. Yes.\n\nThus m+n = 97.\n\nCheck: Are there any other sequences with exactly 5 wins? Could there be sequences where there are two losses but still 5 wins? No, total races 6, need exactly 5 wins, so exactly one loss. So enumeration correct.\n\nThus final answer 97.\n\nLet's craft solution with reasoning.\nLet  \n\n\\[\nW_i=\\text{ “Zou wins race }i\\text{”},\\qquad L_i=\\text{ “Zou loses race }i\\text{”.}\n\\]\n\nThe first race is given to be a win:\n\n\\[\nP(W_1)=1 .\n\\]\n\nFor any later race the conditional probabilities are  \n\n\\[\nP(W_i\\mid W_{i-1})=\\frac23,\\qquad P(L_i\\mid W_{i-1})=\\frac13,\n\\]\n\\[\nP(W_i\\mid L_{i-1})=\\frac13,\\qquad P(L_i\\mid L_{i-1})=\\frac23 .\n\\]\n\nThus the outcomes form a two‑state Markov chain.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 1.

Rectangle ABCD: AB vertical length 3, BC horizontal length 11. Coordinates: Let's set B at origin (0,0). Then AB is vertical up: A = (0,3). BC horizontal right: C = (11,0). D = (11,3). Good.\n\nNow rectangle AECF: vertices A, E, C, F in order? According to diagram, A to E to C to F forms rectangle. So A and C are opposite corners? Actually rectangle AECF: A and C are opposite vertices (diagonal). Since rectangle with side lengths AF=7 and FC=9. Wait AF is side from A to F, FC is side from F to C. So A-F-C are consecutive vertices: A to F side length 7, F to C side length 9, and then C to E side length 7, E to A side length 9? Let's verify: rectangle AECF: vertices in order A-E-C-F? The problem statement says \"AECF is a rectangle with side lengths AF=7 and FC=9\". That suggests AF and FC are adjacent sides, so order A-F-C is a right angle at F. But rectangle named AECF maybe not in order; typical naming of rectangle is consecutive vertices. However they gave side lengths AF and FC, which are not consecutive in naming AECF (A to E, E to C, C to F, F to A). So maybe they purposely gave side lengths of the rectangle's sides that are not adjacent in naming. Let's examine diagram: In Asymptote code: pair A, B, C, D, E, F; A=(0,3); B=(0,0); C=(11,0); D=(11,3); E=foot(C, A, (9/4,0)); F=foot(A, C, (35/4,3)); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--E--C--F--cycle); filldraw(A--(9/4,0)--C--(35/4,3)--cycle,gray*0.5+0.5*lightgray); So they draw rectangle A-E-C-F (A to E to C to F). So indeed rectangle vertices are A, E, C, F in order. So sides are AE, EC, CF, FA. They give side lengths AF=7 and FC=9. So AF is side FA (adjacent to A), FC is side CF (adjacent to C). So rectangle side lengths are 7 and 9. So AE = 9? Wait opposite sides equal: AE opposite CF, so AE = CF = 9? Actually CF is given as 9, so AE = 9. Similarly FA = 7, EC = 7. So rectangle dimensions: width (horizontal?) not aligned with axes; it's slanted.\n\nThus we have rectangle AECF with diagonal AC (since A and C are opposite vertices). Indeed rectangle's diagonal is AC, which is also diagonal of original rectangle ABCD (since A and C are opposite corners of ABCD). So rectangle AECF is inscribed with same diagonal AC but rotated.\n\nWe need area of overlap (intersection) of the two rectangles (interiors). Overlap region is a quadrilateral (maybe a convex quadrilateral) formed by intersection of the two rectangles. According to filldraw they used polygon A--(9/4,0)--C--(35/4,3). Those points are A, point (9/4,0) which is foot from C to line through A? Actually they defined E = foot(C, A, (9/4,0)). foot(C, A, (9/4,0)) means foot of point C onto line through A with direction (9/4,0)? Wait foot(C, A, (9/4,0)) returns projection of C onto line through A with direction vector (9/4,0). That line is horizontal through A? Actually direction (9/4,0) is horizontal, so line through A horizontal y=3. The foot of C onto that line is (11,3)?? No foot of C onto horizontal line y=3 is (11,3) which is D. But they used (9/4,0) as a point? Let's parse: foot(C, A, (9/4,0)) maybe foot of point C onto line through A and point (9/4,0). So line through A (0,3) and point (9/4,0). That's a slanted line. So E is foot of C onto that line. Similarly F = foot(A, C, (35/4,3)) foot of A onto line through C and point (35/4,3). So E and F are the projections of opposite vertices onto the sides of rectangle AECF? Actually rectangle AECF's sides are AE (line through A and E) and AF (line through A and F). So E is on line through A and some point (9/4,0) which is presumably the line AE. So they compute foot of C onto line AE to get E (since rectangle property: AE is perpendicular to AF, and C is opposite vertex, so projection of C onto AE is E). Similarly F is foot of A onto line through C and (35/4,3) which is line CF.\n\nThus coordinates of E and F are given by those foot calculations. They also fill polygon A--(9/4,0)--C--(35/4,3). So the intersection region is quadrilateral with vertices A, point (9/4,0), C, point (35/4,3). Those points are the intersection of rectangle AECF with rectangle ABCD? Let's think: The overlapping region is the part common to both rectangles. Since ABCD is axis-aligned, its interior includes points with 0 ≤ x ≤ 11, 0 ≤ y ≤ 3. The rectangle AECF is slanted, crossing the interior. The overlap region likely is a convex quadrilateral with vertices at A (common corner), C (common opposite corner), and the two points where the slanted rectangle's sides intersect the edges of ABCD: one side AE intersects bottom edge (y=0) at some point (9/4,0). The other side AF intersects top edge (y=3) at (35/4,3). Indeed those are the points used.\n\nThus the overlapping region is a quadrilateral with vertices A (0,3), P = (9/4,0) on bottom edge, C (11,0), Q = (35/4,3) on top edge. So shape is a trapezoid? Actually A and Q are on top edge y=3, P and C on bottom edge y=0. So it's a trapezoid with parallel sides top and bottom (both horizontal). So area = (average of lengths of top and bottom) * height (3). Top length = distance between A (0,3) and Q (35/4,3) = 35/4 = 8.75. Bottom length = distance between P (9/4,0) and C (11,0) = 11 - 9/4 = (44-9)/4 = 35/4 also 8.75. Wait they are equal! So quadrilateral is actually a parallelogram? Both top and bottom lengths equal 35/4. So shape is actually a rectangle? But top and bottom are horizontal, so it's a rectangle of width 35/4 and height 3. However left side is not vertical: left side from A (0,3) to P (9/4,0) is slanted; right side from Q (35/4,3) to C (11,0) also slanted. So it's a parallelogram with horizontal bases equal, so it's a rectangle? For a rectangle, sides must be perpendicular; slanted sides are not vertical, but they are symmetric. Actually if top and bottom are horizontal and equal length, the shape is a parallelogram with horizontal bases; the other sides are equal and parallel but not vertical. That's a rectangle only if those sides are vertical (perpendicular). So it's a parallelogram (specifically a rhombus? Not necessarily). But area formula for a parallelogram with base length b and height h (vertical distance) is b*h. Since bases are horizontal, height is vertical distance = 3. So area = (35/4)*3 = 105/4 = 26.25.\n\nBut we must ensure that the overlapping region indeed is that quadrilateral. Let's verify coordinates of intersection points.\n\nWe need to find where line AE (through A and E) meets bottom edge y=0. That point is (x1,0). Similarly line AF meets top edge y=3 at (x2,3). According to Asymptote they are (9/4,0) and (35/4,3). Let's compute using geometry.\n\nWe know rectangle AECF has side lengths AF=7, FC=9, and diagonal AC length? Compute AC distance: from (0,3) to (11,0): sqrt(11^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(121+9)= sqrt130.\n\nIn a rectangle, diagonal length d satisfies d^2 = a^2 + b^2 where a,b are side lengths. So a=7, b=9 => d = sqrt(7^2+9^2)= sqrt(49+81)= sqrt130. Indeed matches AC. Good.\n\nThus rectangle AECF is uniquely determined: it's the rectangle with diagonal AC and side lengths 7 and 9. There are two possible orientations (rotated one way or the other). The given diagram shows rectangle oriented such that side AF (length 7) goes from A upward-right? Actually A at top-left, C at bottom-right. AF is one side from A to somewhere on top edge? Wait AF is side of rectangle, length 7, connecting A to F which lies on top edge? Actually F is on top edge y=3 (since they used foot of A onto line through C and (35/4,3) which is top edge). So F is on top edge of ABCD (y=3). So AF is horizontal? No, AF is slanted, connecting A (0,3) to F (some x>0, y=3). Wait both have y=3, so AF would be horizontal if F also has y=3. But they said AF length 7, and top edge length is 11, so possible. However if AF is horizontal, then rectangle would have one side horizontal, making rectangle axis-aligned, which is not the case because other side would be vertical, but C is not directly below F. Let's compute: If F is on top edge y=3, then AF is along top edge, horizontal length = x_F - 0. That would be 7, so x_F =7. But they gave x_F = 35/4 = 8.75, not 7. So AF is not horizontal; F is not on top edge? Wait they used foot of A onto line through C and (35/4,3). That line passes through C (11,0) and point (35/4,3) which is on top edge. So line CF passes through C and Q (35/4,3). So Q is intersection of line CF with top edge. So Q is point on top edge where side CF meets top edge. So Q is not a vertex of rectangle AECF; rectangle vertices are A, E, C, F. So F is not on top edge; rather F is on left side? Let's re-evaluate.\n\nFrom code: F=foot(A, C, (35/4,3)); foot(A, C, (35/4,3)) is foot of point A onto line through C and (35/4,3). So line through C and (35/4,3) is side CF of rectangle. The foot of A onto that line is point F, which is the projection of A onto CF, i.e., the point where side AF meets CF at right angle (since rectangle). So F lies on CF, not on top edge. The point (35/4,3) is the intersection of line CF with top edge y=3. So they used that point for shading polygon.\n\nThus the overlapping region vertices are A, intersection of AE with bottom edge (call P), C, intersection of CF with top edge (call Q). So indeed P = (9/4,0) and Q = (35/4,3). Good.\n\nThus area of overlap = area of quadrilateral A-P-C-Q. Since top and bottom edges are horizontal, area = (average of lengths of top and bottom) * height = ((AQ length + PC length)/2) * 3? Wait top base is AQ (distance between A (0,3) and Q (35/4,3)) = 35/4. Bottom base is PC (distance between P (9/4,0) and C (11,0)) = 35/4 as computed. So both equal, so area = base * height = (35/4)*3 = 105/4.\n\nBut we must ensure that the overlapping region is exactly that quadrilateral, not larger (maybe includes also region near left side?). Since rectangle AECF extends beyond ABCD on left side? Let's think: rectangle AECF has vertices A (0,3) inside ABCD, C (11,0) inside, E somewhere on left side? Actually E is foot of C onto line through A and (9/4,0). That line AE passes through A and intersects bottom edge at P (9/4,0). So E is somewhere on that line between A and P? Since foot of C onto line AE is the perpendicular projection; E is the point on AE such that CE is perpendicular to AE. So E lies between A and P (maybe). Similarly F lies between A and Q? Actually F is foot of A onto line CF, so F lies on CF between C and Q. So rectangle AECF is inside the larger rectangle? Let's picture: The rectangle AECF is slanted, with diagonal AC across the big rectangle. Its sides intersect the boundaries of ABCD at points P and Q, but the rectangle itself extends beyond those boundaries? Actually side AE goes from A to E (inside), then continues to intersect bottom edge at P (outside rectangle). So the rectangle AECF is fully inside ABCD? Let's test: Since AE is a side of rectangle, the rectangle lies on one side of AE (the side containing C). Since AE goes from A downwards to the right, the rectangle extends to the right of AE, which includes C and beyond maybe. The intersection of rectangle with ABCD is the quadrilateral A-P-C-Q? Wait rectangle includes points beyond bottom edge? No rectangle side AE is inside ABCD from A to E, then continues beyond to intersect bottom edge at P, but the rectangle side is only segment AE, not the extension. So rectangle does not include region beyond AE. So the overlapping region is the region of rectangle that lies within ABCD, which is bounded by A, the intersection of side AE with bottom edge? Actually side AE ends at E, which is inside ABCD, not at bottom edge. So the overlapping region includes triangle A-E-C? Let's examine shape: rectangle AECF vertices: A (0,3), E (somewhere inside), C (11,0), F (somewhere inside). The rectangle is slanted; its interior is convex quadrilateral. The intersection with ABCD (axis-aligned rectangle) will be a polygon possibly with up to 6 vertices, but due to geometry maybe quadrilateral A-P-C-Q? Let's compute coordinates of E and F to see.\n\nWe can compute using geometry: Let vector AC = (11, -3). The rectangle sides are perpendicular. Let side vector u = vector AF of length 7, and vector v = vector AE of length 9, with u ⟂ v, and u+v = AC (since moving from A to C via rectangle: A -> F (u) -> C (v) or A -> E (v) -> C (u). Actually order A-E-C-F: A to E is one side (length 9), E to C is other side (length 7). So vector AE = v (length 9), vector EC = u (length 7). So v + u = AC. So we can solve for u and v as components.\n\nLet u = (ux, uy), v = (vx, vy). Conditions:\n1) u·v = 0 (perpendicular)\n2) |u| = 7, |v| = 9\n3) u + v = (11, -3)\n\nWe can solve. Let’s treat unknowns.\n\nFrom (3), v = (11, -3) - u.\n\nPlug into dot product: u·[(11, -3) - u] = 0 => u·(11, -3) - |u|^2 = 0 => u·(11, -3) = |u|^2 = 49.\n\nLet u = (x, y). Then 11x -3y = 49. Also x^2 + y^2 = 49.\n\nSolve. From first: 11x - 3y = 49 => 3y = 11x - 49 => y = (11x - 49)/3.\n\nPlug into x^2 + ((11x - 49)/3)^2 = 49.\n\nCompute: x^2 + ( (121x^2 - 1078x + 2401) /9 ) = 49.\n\nMultiply 9: 9x^2 + 121x^2 - 1078x + 2401 = 441.\n\nCombine: (130x^2) - 1078x + 2401 - 441 = 0 => 130x^2 - 1078x + 1960 = 0.\n\nDivide by 2: 65x^2 - 539x + 980 = 0.\n\nSolve quadratic: discriminant D = 539^2 - 4*65*980.\n\nCompute 539^2 = (540-1)^2 = 540^2 -2*540 +1 = 291600 -1080 +1 = 290521.\n\nCompute 4*65*980 = 260*980 = 254800.\n\nSubtract: D = 290521 - 254800 = 35721.\n\nsqrt(D) =? 189^2 = 35721 (since 190^2=36100). Yes sqrt = 189.\n\nThus x = [539 ± 189] / (2*65) = (539 ± 189)/130.\n\nTwo solutions: x1 = (539 + 189)/130 = 728/130 = 56/10 = 28/5 = 5.6. x2 = (539 - 189)/130 = 350/130 = 35/13 ≈ 2.6923.\n\nCorresponding y = (11x - 49)/3.\n\nFor x1 = 28/5 = 5.6", "timestamp": 1758457170, "given_answer": "109", "pred_answer": null, "reference_solution": "Solution 1 (Similar Triangles):\nLet $G$ be the intersection of $AD$ and $FC$ .\nFrom vertical angles, we know that $\\angle FGA= \\angle DGC$ .

These equations are equal, so we can solve for $x$ and obtain $x = \\frac{3}{8}$ . Thus, $18x = \\frac{27}{4}$ , so the area of the parallelogram is $33 - \\frac{27}{4} = \\frac{105}{4}$ .\n\nFinally, the answer is $105+4=\\boxed{109}$ .\n\n~mathboy100\n\nSolution 3 (Pythagorean Theorem):\nLet the intersection of $AE$ and $BC$ be $G$ , and let $BG=x$ , so $CG=11-x$ .\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, ${AG}^2={AB}^2+{BG}^2$ , so $AG=\\sqrt{x^2+9}$ , and thus $EG=9-\\sqrt{x^2+9}$ .\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem again, ${CG}^2={EG}^2+{CE}^2$ : \\[11-x=\\sqrt{7^2+(9-\\sqrt{x^2+9})^2}.\\]\n\nSolving, we get $x=\\frac{9}{4}$ , so the area of the parallelogram is $3\\cdot\\left(11-\\frac{9}{4}\\right)=\\frac{105}{4}$ , and $105+4=\\framebox{109}$ .\n\n~JulianaL25\n\nSolution 4 (Pythagorean Theorem):\nLet $P = AD \\cap FC$ , and $K = AE \\cap BC$ .

Usually integral powers means integer exponent, could be negative, giving fractions. But difference must be integer positive less than 1000. If we allow negative exponents, 2^{-1}=1/2 etc, difference may not be integer. So likely they mean nonnegative integer exponents (i.e., powers of 2). Usually contest problems: \"integral powers of 2\" means numbers of the form 2^k where k is a nonnegative integer. We'll assume a,b >=0.\n\nThus n = 2^a - 2^b with a > b >=0. Factor: n = 2^b (2^{a-b} -1). So n is of form 2^b * (odd number of form 2^c -1 where c = a-b >=1). So n = 2^b * (2^c -1) where c>=1, b>=0.\n\nWe need n<1000.\n\nWe need to count distinct n.\n\nWe can iterate over possible c (odd factor) and b.\n\nLet odd factor m = 2^c -1. For c>=1, m is odd (since 2^c is even, minus 1 odd). Values: c=1 =>1, c=2=>3, c=3=>7, c=4=>15, c=5=>31, c=6=>63, c=7=>127, c=8=>255, c=9=>511, c=10=>1023 (>1000). So c up to 9 gives m <=511.\n\nNow for each m, we can multiply by powers of 2 (2^b) as long as product <1000.\n\nSo for each m, count number of b >=0 such that 2^b * m < 1000.\n\nLet max b = floor(log2(999/m)). Number of b = maxb+1 (including b=0). Provided maxb >=0.\n\nCompute for each m:\n\nc=1, m=1. Need 2^b <1000 => b_max = floor(log2 999) = floor(9.96) =9. So b=0..9 =>10 numbers. Those are all powers of 2 less than 1000 (including 1). Indeed n = 2^a - 2^b with c=1 means a-b=1 => a=b+1, so n = 2^b (2-1)=2^b. So all powers of 2 less than 1000 count.\n\nc=2, m=3. Need 3*2^b <1000 => 2^b < 1000/3 ≈333.33 => b_max = floor(log2 333) = floor(8.38)=8. So b=0..8 =>9 numbers.\n\nc=3, m=7. Need 7*2^b <1000 => 2^b < 1000/7≈142.857 => b_max = floor(log2 142) = floor(7.15)=7. So 0..7 =>8 numbers.\n\nc=4, m=15. Need 15*2^b <1000 => 2^b < 66.666 => b_max = floor(log2 66)= floor(6.04)=6. So 0..6 =>7 numbers.\n\nc=5, m=31. Need 31*2^b <1000 => 2^b < 32.258 => b_max = floor(log2 32)=5 (since 2^5=32 <=32.258). So b=0..5 =>6 numbers.\n\nc=6, m=63. Need 63*2^b <1000 => 2^b < 15.873 => b_max = floor(log2 15)=3 (2^3=8, 2^4=16 >15.873). So b=0..3 =>4 numbers.\n\nc=7, m=127. Need 127*2^b <1000 => 2^b < 7.874 => b_max = floor(log2 7)=2 (2^2=4, 2^3=8 >7.874). So b=0..2 =>3 numbers.\n\nc=8, m=255. Need 255*2^b <1000 => 2^b < 3.9216 => b_max = floor(log2 3)=1 (2^1=2, 2^2=4 >3.92). So b=0..1 =>2 numbers.\n\nc=9, m=511. Need 511*2^b <1000 => 2^b < 1.956 => b_max = floor(log2 1)=0 (since 2^0=1). So b=0 only =>1 number.\n\nNow total numbers = sum of counts: 10+9+8+7+6+4+3+2+1 = ?\n\nCompute: 10+9=19, +8=27, +7=34, +6=40, +4=44, +3=47, +2=49, +1=50.\n\nSo 50 distinct positive integers less than 1000 can be expressed as difference of two powers of 2.\n\nBut need to ensure no duplicates across different (c,b) pairs. Could same n arise from different representations? Let's check: n = 2^b (2^c -1). Since factorization into odd part (2^c -1) is unique because odd part is odd, and 2^b is the highest power of 2 dividing n. Since (2^c -1) is odd, the exponent b is exactly the 2-adic valuation of n. So representation is unique. So counts are distinct.\n\nThus answer 50.\n\nEdge cases: Are we allowed a,b equal? Then n=0 not positive. So fine.\n\nCheck that all n <1000 indeed can be expressed? Not needed.\n\nThus final answer 50.\n\nLet's craft solution with reasoning.\n\n\nLet  \n\n\\[\nn=2^{a}-2^{b}\\qquad (a>b\\ge 0)\n\\]\n\nbe a positive integer less than \\(1000\\).  \nFactor out the smaller power:\n\n\\[\nn=2^{b}\\bigl(2^{a-b}-1\\bigr).\n\\]\n\nSet  \n\n\\[\nc=a-b\\;(c\\ge 1),\\qquad m=2^{c}-1 .\n\\]\n\nThen  \n\n\\[\nn=2^{b}\\,m ,\\qquad m\\text{ is odd}.\n\\]\n\nThus every such \\(n\\) is a product of a power of two and an odd number of the special form  \n\n\\[\nm=2^{c}-1\\;(c\\ge 1).\n\\]\n\nConversely, any integer of the form \\(2^{b}(2^{c}-1)\\) with \\(b\\ge 0,\\;c\\ge 1\\) can be written as a difference of two powers of two (take \\(a=b+c\\)).  \nHence we only have to count the distinct numbers  \n\n\\[\nn=2^{b}(2^{c}-1)<1000 .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 1.

We first observe $a$ must be at most 10; if $a \\ge 11$ , then $2^a - 2^b \\ge 2^{10} > 1000$ . As $2^{10} = 1024 \\approx 1000$ , we can first choose two different numbers $a > b$ from the set $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$ in $\\binom{11}{2}=55$ ways. This includes $(a,b) = (10,0)$ , $(10,1)$ , $(10,2)$ , $(10,3)$ , $(10,4)$ which are invalid as $2^a - 2^b > 1000$ in this case. For all other choices $a$ and $b$ , the value of $2^a - 2^b$ is less than 1000.\n\nWe claim that for all other choices of $a$ and $b$ , the values of $2^a - 2^b$ are pairwise distinct. More specifically, if $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ where $10 \\ge a_1 > b_1 \\ge 0$ and $10 \\ge a_2 > b_2 \\ge 0$ , we must show that $2^{a_1}-2^{b_1} \\neq 2^{a_2} - 2^{b_2}$ . Suppose otherwise for sake of contradiction; rearranging yields $2^{a_1}+2^{b_2} = 2^{a_2}+2^{b_1}$ . We use the fact that every positive integer has a unique binary representation:\n\nIf $a_1 \\neq b_2$ then $\\{a_1,b_2\\} = \\{a_2,b_1\\}$ ; from here we can deduce either $a_1=a_2$ and $b_1=b_2$ (contradicting the assumption that $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ , or $a_1=b_1$ and $a_2=b_2$ (contradicting the assumption $a_1>b_1$ and $a_2>b_2$ ).\n\nIf $a_1 = b_2$ then $2^{a_1}+2^{b_2} = 2 \\times 2^{a_1}$ , and it follows that $a_1=a_2=b_1=b_2$ , also contradicting the assumption $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ . Hence we obtain contradiction.*\n\nThen there are $\\binom{11}{2}-5$ choices for $(a,b)$ for which $2^a - 2^b$ is a positive integer less than 1000; by the above claim, each choice of $(a,b)$ results in a different positive integer $n$ . Then there are $55-5 = \\boxed{050}$ integers which can be expressed as a difference of two powers of 2.\n\nNote: The uniqueness of binary representation could be rather easily proven, but if you cannot convince yourself on the spot that this is the case, consider the following alternative proof.

Our answer needs to be less than $1000$ , so the maximum possible result (in this case) is $2^9-2^0$ . Our lowest result is $2^1-2^0$ . All the positive powers of two less than $1024$ work, so we have $9$ possibilities for this subcase. For subcases $i=1, i=2, i=3,$ and $i=4$ , we have $8, 7, 6,$ and $5$ possibilities, respectively.\n\nCase 2: When our answer is in the form of $2^n-2^j$ , where $j$ is an integer such that $5\\le j\\le 9$ .\n\nWe can start with the subcase where $j=5$ . We notice that $2^5=32$ , and $2^{10}-2^5=992$ which is less than $1000$ , so the greatest result in this subcase is actually $2^{10}-2^5$ , and the lowest is $2^6-2^5$ . Thus, we have $5$ possibilities. For the other four subcases, we have $4, 3, 2,$ and $1$ possibilities, respectively.\n\nAnswer: We note that these are our only cases, as numbers in the form of $2^n-2^{10}$ and beyond are greater than $1000$ .\n\nThus, our result is $9+8+7+6+5+5+4+3+2+1=(9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1)+5=\\boxed{50}$ . ~jehu26\n\nSolution 3 (Bash):\nWe look for all positive integers of the form $2^a-2^b<1000,$ where $0\\leq b<a.$ Performing casework on $a,$ we can enumerate all possibilities in the table below: \\[\\begin{array}{c|c} & \\\\ [-2.25ex] \\boldsymbol{a} & \\boldsymbol{b} \\\\  \\hline  & \\\\ [-2ex] 1 & 0 \\\\   2 & 0,1 \\\\ 3 & 0,1,2 \\\\ 4 & 0,1,2,3 \\\\ 5 & 0,1,2,3,4 \\\\ 6 & 0,1,2,3,4,5 \\\\ 7 & 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 \\\\ 8 & 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 \\\\ 9 & 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \\\\ 10 & \\xcancel{0},\\xcancel{1},\\xcancel{2},\\xcancel{3},\\xcancel{4},5,6,7,8,9 \\\\ [0.5ex] \\end{array}\\] As indicated by the X-marks, the ordered pairs $(a,b)=(10,0),(10,1),(10,2),(10,3),(10,4)$ generate $2^a-2^b>1000,$ which are invalid.\n\nNote that each of the remaining ordered pairs generates one unique desired positive integer.\n\nWe prove this statement as follows:\n\nThe positive integers generated for each value of $a$ are clearly different. For all integers $k$ such that $1\\leq k\\leq9,$ the largest positive integer generated for $a=k$ is $1$ less than the smallest positive integer generated for $a=k+1.$\n\nTogether, we have justified our claim in bold. The answer is \\[1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+5=\\boxed{050}.\\]\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSolution 4 (Faster Way):\nBecause the difference is less than $1000$ , we can simply list out all numbers that satisfy $2^n < 1000$ . We get $0 \\le n < 10$ , where n is an integer. Because the sequence $2^n$ is geometric, the difference of any two terms will be unique. $\\binom{10}{2}$ will be the number of differences for $0\\le n < 10$ . However, we also need to consider the case in which $n=10$ . With simple counting, we find that $5$ numbers: $(32, 64, 128, 256, 512)$ could be subtracted from $1024$ , which makes another 5 cases. There is no need to check for higher exponents since the lowest difference would be $2^{11} - 2^{10} = 1024$ , which exceeds $1000$ .\n\nThus, the final answer is $\\binom{10}{2} + 5 = \\boxed{050}.$\n\n~TOMYANG"}

Suppose we have $2$ coins in the first pile, then $(2, 3, 61), (2, 4, 60), \\ldots, (2, 31, 33)$ all work, for a total of $29$ . Continuing this pattern until $21$ coins in the first pile, we have the sum \\begin{align*} 31+29+28+26+25+\\cdots+4+2+1 &= (31+28+25+22+\\cdots+1)+(29+26+23+\\cdots+2) \\\\ &= 176+155 \\\\ &= \\boxed{331}. \\end{align*}\n\nSolution 2:\nWe make an equation: $a+b+c=66,$ where $a<b<c.$ We don't have a clear solution, so we'll try complementary counting. First, let's find where $a\\geq b\\geq c.$ By stars and bars, we have $\\dbinom{65}{2}=2080$ to assign positive integer solutions to $a + b + c = 66.$ Now we need to subtract off the cases where it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nWe start with $a = b.$ We can write that as $2b + c = 66.$ We can find there are 32 integer solutions to this equation. There are $32$ solutions for $b=c$ and $a = c$ by symmetry. We also need to add back $2$ because we subtracted $(a,b,c)=(22,22,22)$ $3$ times.\n\nWe then have to divide by $6$ because there are $3!=6$ ways to order $a, b,$ and $c.$ Therefore, we have $\\dfrac{\\dbinom{65}{2}-96+2}{6} = \\dfrac{1986}{6} = \\boxed{331}.$\n\n~Arcticturn\n\nSolution 3:\nLet the piles have $a, b$ and $c$ coins, with $0 < a < b < c$ . Then, let $b = a + k_1$ , and $c = b + k_2$ , such that each $k_i \\geq 1$ . The sum is then $a + a+k_1 + a+k_1+k_2 = 66 \\implies 3a+2k_1 + k_2 = 66$ . This is simply the number of positive solutions to the equation $3x+2y+z = 66$ . Now, we take cases on $a$ .\n\nIf $a = 1$ , then $2k_1 + k_2 = 63 \\implies 1 \\leq k_1 \\leq 31$ . Each value of $k_1$ corresponds to a unique value of $k_2$ , so there are $31$ solutions in this case. Similarly, if $a = 2$ , then $2k_1 + k_2 = 60 \\implies 1 \\leq k_1 \\leq 29$ , for a total of $29$ solutions in this case. If $a = 3$ , then $2k_1 + k_2 = 57 \\implies 1 \\leq k_1 \\leq 28$ , for a total of $28$ solutions. In general, the number of solutions is just all the numbers that aren't a multiple of $3$ , that are less than or equal to $31$ .\n\nWe then add our cases to get \\begin{align*} 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + \\cdots + 31 &= 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 31 - 3(1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 10) \\\\ &= \\frac{31(32)}{2} - 3(55) \\\\ &= 31 \\cdot 16 - 165 \\\\ &= 496 - 165 \\\\ &= \\boxed{331} \\end{align*} as our answer.\n\nSolution 4:\nLet the first pile have $a$ coins, the second $a+b$ coins, and the third $a+b+c$ coins, where $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are strictly positive integers. Thus the total number of coins is $3a+2b+c=66$ . Perform the substitution $x=a-1$ , $y=b-1$ , and $z=c-1$ to yield the equation $3x+2y+z=60$ , where $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ are instead nonnegative integers.\n\nFrom here we can set up the generating function $(x^0+x^3+\\cdots+x^{60})(x^0+x^2+\\cdots+x^{60})(x^0+x^1+\\cdots+x^{60})$ . We need to find the coefficient of $x^{60}$ . Multiplying the second and third polynomials with clever reasoning returns\n\n$(x^0+x^3+\\cdots+x^{60})(x^0+x^1+2x^2+2x^3+\\cdots+31x^{60}+\\cdots+2x^{117}+2x^{118}+x^{119}+x^{120})$\n\nwhere in the second polynomial, for every two terms, the coefficient increases or decreases by one (depending on which side of the polynomial the term resides).\n\nOne can notice here that for every term in the first polynomial there exists one and only one term in the second polynomial that, when multiplied, yield $x^{60}$ . Furthermore, we need only consider the coefficients of the second polynomial.\n\nThe corresponding coefficient for $x^{60}$ is $1$ , for $x^{57}$ is $2$ , and for $x^{54}$ is $4$ . We notice the pattern: increase by one, increase by two, and so on. When does this pattern stop? For $x^0$ , the corresponding coefficient is $31$ , and we notice that $31\\equiv1\\mod3$ . As a result, we know that the pattern has $21$ terms, and we can take advantage of the first $20$ by symmetry.\n\nThe answer is simply $10(1+29)+31=\\boxed{331}$ .\n\n~eevee9406\n\nSolution 4"}

However x = y - d must be integer; no further restriction.\n\nWe need to find all integer solutions.\n\nLet's solve for y in terms of d perhaps.\n\nFrom y (d^2 - 3 y) = 2 d^2.\n\nConsider this as quadratic in y: -3 y^2 + d^2 y - 2 d^2 = 0, multiply by -1: 3 y^2 - d^2 y + 2 d^2 = 0.\n\nSolve quadratic: y = [d^2 ± sqrt(d^4 - 24 d^2)] / (6). Because discriminant: (d^2)^2 - 4*3*2 d^2 = d^4 - 24 d^2 = d^2 (d^2 - 24). So sqrt = d sqrt(d^2 - 24). Need integer sqrt.\n\nThus we need d sqrt(d^2 - 24) to be integer, and numerator divisible by 6.\n\nLet d>0 integer. Let k = sqrt(d^2 - 24). Then k must be integer, and k >=0. So d^2 - 24 = k^2 => d^2 - k^2 = 24 => (d - k)(d + k) = 24.\n\nSince d and k are nonnegative integers, d>k (since 24>0). Both have same parity because sum and difference are both even? Actually d - k and d + k have same parity (both even). Since product is 24, we can list factor pairs of 24 with same parity.\n\nLet a = d - k, b = d + k, with a*b = 24, a,b positive integers, a <= b, both have same parity (both even). Also d = (a+b)/2, k = (b - a)/2.\n\nNow list factor pairs of 24: (1,24) (2,12) (3,8) (4,6). Also (24,1) etc but a <= b.\n\nCheck parity:\n\n- (1,24): 1 odd, 24 even -> different parity -> not allowed.\n- (2,12): both even -> allowed.\n- (3,8): odd/even -> not allowed.\n- (4,6): both even -> allowed.\n\nAlso (24,1) same as (1,24) not allowed.\n\nThus possible (a,b) = (2,12) or (4,6).\n\nCompute d,k:\n\nCase 1: a=2, b=12 => d = (2+12)/2 = 7, k = (12-2)/2 =5. Check: d^2 - 24 = 49-24=25 = k^2=25 good.\n\nCase 2: a=4, b=6 => d = (4+6)/2 =5, k = (6-4)/2 =1. Check: d^2 -24 =25-24=1 = k^2.\n\nThus d can be 5 or 7.\n\nNow compute y using formula: y = [d^2 ± d k] /6 because sqrt = d k.\n\nSince sqrt = d * k (since sqrt(d^2 (d^2 -24)) = d sqrt(d^2 -24) = d k). So y = (d^2 ± d k)/6 = d (d ± k)/6.\n\nThus y = d (d + k)/6 or y = d (d - k)/6.\n\nNow compute for each d,k.\n\nCase d=5, k=1:\n\nCompute y1 = d (d + k)/6 = 5*(5+1)/6 =5*6/6=5.\ny2 = d (d - k)/6 =5*(5-1)/6 =5*4/6 =20/6 =10/3 not integer. So discard.\n\nThus y =5.\n\nNow compute sequence: d=5, y=5 => x = y - d =0, z = y + d =10. Check strictly increasing? 0<5<10 yes. All integers.\n\nCheck condition: sum squares = 0^2+5^2+10^2=0+25+100=125. RHS: y*d^2 =5*25=125 works.\n\nThus one special sequence: (0,5,10). Third term =10.\n\nCase d=7, k=5:\n\nCompute y1 = d (d + k)/6 =7*(7+5)/6 =7*12/6=7*2=14.\ny2 = d (d - k)/6 =7*(7-5)/6 =7*2/6=14/6=7/3 not integer.\n\nThus y=14.\n\nSequence: x = y - d =14-7=7, y=14, z=21. Strictly increasing yes.\n\nCheck: sum squares = 7^2+14^2+21^2 =49+196+441=686. RHS: y*d^2 =14*49=686 works.\n\nThus second special sequence: (7,14,21). Third term =21.\n\nAre there any other possibilities? We assumed discriminant must be perfect square. We solved d^2 -24 = k^2. That gave limited solutions because factorization of 24. However note that we required sqrt(d^4 -24 d^2) integer. That's d sqrt(d^2 -24). For integer sqrt, we need d^2 -24 to be perfect square. Indeed we solved that.\n\nBut also we need y integer, which required numerator divisible by 6. We checked both ± options; only one gave integer y each case.\n\nCould there be negative d? d is common difference positive (strictly increasing). So only positive.\n\nThus only two sequences.\n\nBut also could there be sequences where y=0? Let's test d maybe zero? Not allowed because strictly increasing.\n\nThus sum of third terms = 10 + 21 = 31.\n\nCheck if any other solutions with d maybe larger where d^2 -24 is perfect square? Let's double-check factorization: d^2 - k^2 =24 => (d - k)(d + k)=24. Since d,k nonnegative integers, both factors positive. We enumerated factor pairs of 24. However note that d - k could be 24 and d + k =1? Not possible because d - k <= d + k. So we covered all with a <= b.\n\nBut also could have a= -?

Then we want $(a-b)^2+a^2+(a+b)^2=ab^2$ , or $3a^2+2b^2=ab^2$ . Rearranging, we get $b^2=\\frac{3a^2}{a-2}$ . Simplifying further, $b^2=3a+6+\\frac{12}{a-2}$ . Looking at this second equation, since the right side must be an integer, $a-2$ must equal $\\pm1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$ . Looking at the first equation, we see $a>2$ since $b^2$ is positive. This means we must test $a=3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 14$ . After testing these, we see that only $a=5$ and $a=14$ work which give $b=5$ and $b=7$ respectively.

Then, we have that the sequence is \\[x-d,~x,~x+d.\\] This means that the sum of the squares of the 3 terms of the sequence is \\[(x-d)^2+x^2+(x+d)^2=x^2-2xd+d^2+x^2+x^2+2xd+d^2=3x^2+2d^2.\\] We know that this must be equal to $xd^2,$ so we can write that \\[3x^2+2d^2=xd^2,\\] and it follows that \\[3x^2-xd^2+2d^2=3x^2-\\left(d^2\\right)x+2d^2=0.\\]\n\nNow, we can treat $d$ as a constant and use the quadratic formula to get \\[x=\\frac{d^2\\pm \\sqrt{d^4-4(3)(2d^2)}}{6}.\\] We can factor pull $d^2$ out of the square root to get \\[x=\\frac{d^2\\pm d\\sqrt{d^2-24}}{6}.\\] Here, it is easy to figure out the values of $d$ . Let $\\sqrt{d^2-24} = k$ , then $d^2-k^2=24$ which is $(d+k)(d-k)=24,$ note that $d$ , $k$ are integers. Examining the parity, we find that $d+k$ and $d-k$ are of the same parity. Now, we solve by factoring. We can find that $d=5$ and $d=7$ are the only positive integer values of $d$ that make $\\sqrt{d^2-24}$ a positive integer. $^{*}$ $d=5$ gives $x=5$ and $x=\\frac{10}{3}$ , but we can ignore the latter. $d=7$ gives $x=14$ , as well as a fraction which we can ignore.\n\nSince $d=5,~x=5$ and $d=7, x=14$ are the only two solutions and we want the sum of the third terms, our answer is $(5+5)+(7+14)=10+21=\\boxed{031}$ . -BorealBear, minor edit by Kinglogic\n\n$^*$ To prove this, let $\\sqrt{d^2-24} = k$ , then $d^2-k^2=24$ which is $(d+k)(d-k)=24,$ then remembering that $d$ and $k$ are integers see if you can figure it out. - PureSwag\n\nSolution 3:\nProceed as in solution 2, until we reach \\[3x^2+2d^2=xd^2,\\] Write\n\n$d^2=\\frac{3x^2}{x-2}$ , it follows that $x-2=3k^2$ for some (positive) integer k and $k \\mid x$ .\n\nTaking both sides modulo $k$ , $-2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{k}$ , so $k \\mid 2 \\rightarrow k=1,2$ .\n\nWhen $k=1$ , we have $x=5$ and $d=5$ .

Then:\n\n$3n^2 = a-2$ . Now when you divide the numerator and denominator by 3, you are left with\n\n$d^2 = \\frac{a^2}{n^2} \\implies d = \\frac{a}{n}$ . Because the sequence is of integers, d must also be an\n\ninteger, which means that $n$ must divide $a$ .\n\nTaking the above equation we can solve for $a$ : $3n^2 = a-2 \\implies a = 3n^2+2$ .\n\nThis means that $3n^2+2$ is divisible by $n$ . $3n^2$ is automatically divisible by $n$ , so\n\n$2$ must be divisible by $n$ . Then $n$ must be either of $\\{1,2\\}$ .

We then get $3p^2+2=pa.$ We then take this to modulo $p$ , getting $2\\equiv 0 \\pmod p.$ The only possibilities for $p$ are therefore 1 and 2. We plug these into $3p^2+2=pa$ , for $a=5$ and $x=5$ , giving us the sequence $0,5,10$ , or $2a=14$ and $x=14$ , for the sequence $7,14,21.$ $10+21 = \\boxed{031}.$\n\n-RYang2"}

Also denote maybe sum variables.\n\nFrom Eq1: S - 2s x + s^2 = 36000 => -2s x = 36000 - S - s^2. So x = (S + s^2 - 36000)/(2s). (A)\n\nSimilarly Eq2: S - 2s y + s^2 = 18000 => y = (S + s^2 - 18000)/(2s). (B)\n\nEq3: S - 2s z + s^2 = 28800 => z = (S + s^2 - 28800)/(2s). (C)\n\nNow plug into Eq4.\n\nCompute x + y + z = [ (S + s^2 - 36000) + (S + s^2 - 18000) + (S + s^2 - 28800) ] / (2s) = [3S + 3 s^2 - (36000+18000+28800)]/(2s).\n\nSum constants: 36000+18000+28800 = 82800.\n\nThus x+y+z = (3S + 3 s^2 - 82800)/(2s) = (3 (S + s^2) - 82800)/(2s).\n\nNow Eq4: S - 2s (x+y+z) + 3 s^2 = 9072.\n\nPlug x+y+z:\n\n-2s (x+y+z) = -2s * [ (3 (S + s^2) - 82800)/(2s) ] = -(3 (S + s^2) - 82800) = -3 (S + s^2) + 82800.\n\nThus Eq4 becomes:\n\nS + [ -3 (S + s^2) + 82800 ] + 3 s^2 = 9072.\n\nSimplify: S -3S -3 s^2 + 82800 + 3 s^2 = 9072.\n\nThe -3 s^2 + 3 s^2 cancel. So we have S -3S = -2S. So -2S + 82800 = 9072 => -2S = 9072 - 82800 = -73728 => 2S = 73728 => S = 36864.\n\nThus AP^2 = 36864. So AP = sqrt(36864). Compute sqrt: 36864 = 36,864. Let's factor: 36864 = 36 * 1024? Actually 1024*36 = 36864 indeed (since 1024*30=30720, plus 1024*6=6144, sum 36864). So sqrt = sqrt(36*1024) = 6*32 = 192. So AP = 192.\n\nCheck if consistent with other equations to find s maybe not needed. But we can verify.\n\nNow compute s? Use Eq1: S - 2s x + s^2 = 36000. We have S=36864. Need x expression: x = (S + s^2 - 36000)/(2s). Let's compute S + s^2 - 36000 = 36864 + s^2 - 36000 = 864 + s^2. So x = (s^2 + 864)/(2s).\n\nNow compute S - 2s x + s^2 = 36864 - 2s * ((s^2+864)/(2s)) + s^2 = 36864 - (s^2+864) + s^2 = 36864 - s^2 - 864 + s^2 = 36000. Works automatically (since derived). So any s works? Wait we didn't use any other constraints to solve s. But we have also Eq2 and Eq3 which will give same consistency? Let's test.\n\nFrom Eq2: S - 2s y + s^2 = 18000. Using y = (S + s^2 - 18000)/(2s) = (36864 + s^2 - 18000)/(2s) = (s^2 + 18864)/(2s). Then compute S - 2s y + s^2 = 36864 - (s^2 + 18864) + s^2 = 36864 - s^2 - 18864 + s^2 = 18000. Works.\n\nSimilarly Eq3 works. So s cancels; any s yields same S? That seems surprising but maybe distances are consistent for any cube size? Let's verify with Eq4 also gave S independent of s. Indeed we solved S without s. So AP is uniquely determined independent of edge length. Good.\n\nThus answer AP = 192.\n\nCheck if distances plausible: For some s, compute coordinates maybe. Choose s convenient to make coordinates integer? Let's solve for s using maybe x,y,z positive? Use x expression: x = (s^2 + 864)/(2s) = (s/2) + 432/s. Similarly y = (s^2 + 18864)/(2s) = s/2 + 9432/s. z = (s^2 + 1152? Wait compute: S + s^2 - 28800 = 36864 + s^2 - 28800 = s^2 + 8064. So z = (s^2 + 8064)/(2s) = s/2 + 4032/s.\n\nWe need these coordinates to satisfy distances maybe positive. Choose s such that these are within [0,s]? Not necessarily; P could be outside cube. Let's test s maybe 48? Then s/2=24, 432/s=9, so x=33. y: 9432/48=196.5, plus 24 = 220.5 > s. So not inside. Maybe s larger. Let's find s such that x,y,z maybe positive but not necessarily less than s.

So need both equal 1.\n\nThus need existence of x such that mx ≡ π/2 + 2πk (mod 2π) and nx ≡ π/2 + 2πℓ (mod 2π) for some integers k,ℓ.\n\nEquivalently, mx = π/2 + 2πk, nx = π/2 + 2πℓ.\n\nWe can write x = (π/2 + 2πk)/m = (π/2 + 2πℓ)/n.\n\nThus need equality: (π/2 + 2πk)/m = (π/2 + 2πℓ)/n.\n\nMultiply both sides by mn: n(π/2 + 2πk) = m(π/2 + 2πℓ).\n\nDivide by π: n(1/2 + 2k) = m(1/2 + 2ℓ).\n\nLet’s define A = 1/2 + 2k = (1+4k)/2, similarly B = 1/2 + 2ℓ = (1+4ℓ)/2.\n\nThus condition: n A = m B, where A,B are numbers of form (odd)/2.\n\nSo n*(odd)/2 = m*(odd)/2 => n*odd1 = m*odd2, where odd1, odd2 are odd integers.\n\nThus we need existence of odd integers p,q such that n p = m q.\n\nEquivalently, the ratio n/m = q/p where p,q odd.\n\nThus n/m must be a rational number expressed as ratio of two odd integers.\n\nSince m,n are integers, n/m is rational already. The condition is that after reducing fraction to lowest terms, both numerator and denominator are odd.\n\nLet’s write n/m = a/b in lowest terms (a,b positive integers, gcd(a,b)=1). Then we need a and b both odd.\n\nBecause if a,b odd, we can set p = a, q = b (both odd) and have n p = m q? Wait check: n/m = a/b => n = m a/b => cross-multiply: n b = m a. So set p = b (odd), q = a (odd). Then n p = n b = m a = m q. So condition satisfied.\n\nConversely, if there exist odd p,q with n p = m q, then n/m = q/p, reduce fraction: q/p may reduce further if they share common factor, but since both odd, any common factor is odd. After reduction, numerator and denominator remain odd. So the reduced fraction a/b must have both odd.\n\nThus condition: reduced fraction n/m has odd numerator and denominator.\n\nThus count pairs (m,n) with 1 ≤ m < n ≤ 30 such that when we write n/m in lowest terms, both numerator and denominator are odd.\n\nEquivalently, m and n have same power of 2 factor: Let m = 2^α * u, n = 2^β * v, where u,v odd. Then reduced fraction n/m = (2^β v)/(2^α u) = 2^{β-α} * (v/u). Reduce: cancel any common odd factor between v and u. The numerator after reduction will be odd times possibly a power of 2. For both numerator and denominator to be odd, we need β = α (same exponent of 2), because otherwise there will be a factor 2 in numerator or denominator after reduction. Also after canceling odd gcd, the remaining odd parts will be odd. So condition: v and u can have any odd gcd; after reduction both odd. That's fine.\n\nThus condition reduces to: m and n have the same exponent of 2 in prime factorization (i.e., v2(m) = v2(n)). Where v2(k) is the 2-adic valuation (largest exponent of 2 dividing k). Because then the fraction n/m after canceling common odd factors will have no factor 2 left.\n\nThus we need count of pairs (m,n) with 1 ≤ m < n ≤ 30 such that v2(m) = v2(n).\n\nLet's compute.\n\nList numbers 1..30 with their v2:\n\n1:0\n2:1\n3:0\n4:2\n5:0\n6:1 (2*3)\n7:0\n8:3\n9:0\n10:1\n11:0\n12:2 (4*3)\n13:0\n14:1\n15:0\n16:4\n17:0\n18:1 (2*9)\n19:0\n20:2 (4*5)\n21:0\n22:1\n23:0\n24:3 (8*3)\n25:0\n26:1\n27:0\n28:2 (4*7)\n29:0\n30:1 (2*15)\n\nNow group by v2 value.\n\nv2=0 (odd numbers): list odds up to 30: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29.

That's 1 number.\n\nHigher v2 not present.\n\nNow for each group of size k, number of ordered pairs (m,n) with m<n is C(k,2) = k(k-1)/2.\n\nCompute:\n\nv2=0: k=15 => 15*14/2 = 105\nv2=1: k=8 => 8*7/2 = 28\nv2=2: k=4 => 4*3/2 = 6\nv2=3: k=2 => 2*1/2 = 1\nv2=4: k=1 => 0\n\nTotal = 105+28+6+1 = 140.\n\nThus there are 140 pairs.\n\nCheck if any extra condition about existence of x real? We already ensured both sines can be 1 simultaneously. Need to verify that for any such pair, there indeed exists x solving both equations. Since we derived condition equivalently, yes.\n\nConstruct x: Let m = 2^a u, n = 2^a v with u,v odd. Need x such that mx ≡ π/2 (mod 2π) and nx ≡ π/2 (mod 2π). Since both have same 2-adic exponent, we can set x = π/2 * (1/m) + 2π * t/m for integer t. Need also satisfy nx condition: n x = n*(π/2m + 2π t/m) = (n/m)*(π/2) + 2π n t / m. Since n/m = v/u (odd/odd). Choose t such that n t / m is integer? Actually we need nx ≡ π/2 (mod 2π). Compute nx = (v/u)*(π/2) + 2π (n t / m). Since v/u is rational with odd numerator denominator. Write v/u = p/q in lowest terms with p,q odd (actually p=v/gcd(v,u), q=u/gcd(v,u)). Then (v/u)*(π/2) = (p/q)*(π/2). Need this plus integer multiple of 2π to be congruent to π/2 mod 2π. That is (p/q)*(π/2) ≡ π/2 (mod 2π). Multiply by 2/π: p/q ≡ 1 (mod 4). Since p,q odd, p/q mod 4? Actually we can adjust t to make up difference. Since 2π n t / m = 2π * (n/m) t = 2π * (v/u) t. So total nx = (v/u)*(π/2 + 2π t). Choose t such that (π/2 + 2π t) is multiple of π? Wait maybe easier: Since we have equality condition earlier, there exist integers k,ℓ solving n(π/2+2πk)=m(π/2+2πℓ). This is equivalent to existence of integer solution to n* (1/2+2k) = m*(1/2+2ℓ). Since v2(m)=v2(n), we can find such k,ℓ. So existence is guaranteed.\n\nThus answer 140.\n\nLet's produce final answer.\nFor  \n\n\\[\n\\sin(mx)+\\sin(nx)=2\n\\]\n\nthe sine values must each be the maximal value \\(1\\).  \nHence we need  \n\n\\[\n\\sin(mx)=1,\\qquad \\sin(nx)=1 .\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 1.

Indeed roots are t = 10 ± sqrt(100 - k). Both in [0,20].\n- In t≥20 region, solve t^2 -20t = k => t^2 -20t - k =0 => discriminant D' = 400 +4k >0, gives one positive root >20? Let's compute roots: t = 10 ± sqrt(100 + k). Since sqrt>10, the minus root is negative (10 - >10) maybe negative; the plus root is >20. So exactly one solution t>20. So total t solutions = 3 (distinct positive t). Also possibly t=0? t=0 gives f=0, which equals k only if k=0. That's included in the quadratic solutions? For k=0, the roots in [0,20] are t=0 and t=20. So we have t=0,20 plus the >20 root (which for k=0 gives t=20? Wait solve t^2 -20t =0 => t=0 or 20. But t≥20 region gives t=20 as solution as well, overlapping. So need careful count for k=0. We'll treat later.\n\nCase 2: k = 100. Then in [0,20] we have double root at t=10 (since discriminant zero). So one solution there (t=10). In t≥20 region, solve t^2 -20t =100 => t^2 -20t -100=0 => discriminant 400+400=800, sqrt = 20*sqrt2 ≈28.284. Roots: t = 10 ± sqrt(100+100)=10 ± sqrt200=10 ± 10√2 ≈10 ±14.14. Positive >20 root: 10+14.14=24.14 >20. The other root negative. So total distinct t solutions = 2 (t=10 and t≈24.14). Also t=0? not solution because k=100 not zero.\n\nCase 3: k > 100. Then in [0,20] no solution because max 100. In t≥20 region, quadratic gives two positive roots? Let's see: t^2 -20t = k => t^2 -20t - k =0. Discriminant D' = 400 +4k >0. Roots: t = 10 ± sqrt(100 + k). Since sqrt > sqrt(100+100)=~14.14 >10, the minus root is negative, the plus root positive >20. So exactly one positive root >20. So total t solutions =1.\n\nThus summary for k>0 (nonzero):\n- 0<k<100: 3 t solutions (two in (0,20), one >20)\n- k=100: 2 t solutions\n- k>100: 1 t solution\n\nFor k=0: f(t)=0 => t=0 or t=20 (both). Also t≥20 region gives t=0? No, t≥20 gives t=0 not allowed. So total t solutions =2 (t=0,20). (Note t=20 also appears as root of both pieces but counted once.)\n\nNow each positive t (t>0) gives two x (±t). t=0 gives one x (0). So number of x solutions N = 2*(number of positive t solutions) + (1 if t=0 solution else 0).\n\nNow we have two equations: f(t)=k1 where k1 = c+21, and f(t)=k2 where k2 = c-21 (provided they are ≥0). Solutions are union of t solutions for each k. Need total distinct x solutions =12.\n\nWe need to consider possible overlaps: a t could satisfy both equations if k1 = k2 i.e., 21= -21 impossible. Or if same t solves both with different k? Not possible because f(t) is single-valued; cannot equal two different numbers. So solution sets for each k are disjoint (unless one of k's is negative, then that equation has no solutions). So total t solutions = sum of t solutions for each valid k.\n\nThus we need to consider cases based on c.\n\nLet’s define k1 = c+21, k2 = c-21.\n\nBoth must be ≥0 for equations to have solutions. If one is negative, that branch contributes zero solutions.\n\nWe need total x count =12.\n\nLet’s compute number of t solutions for each k based on its value relative to 0,100.\n\nDefine function T(k) = number of t≥0 solutions to f(t)=k.\n\nFrom above:\n- If k=0: T=2 (t=0,20)\n- If 0<k<100: T=3\n- If k=100: T=2\n- If k>100: T=1\n\nNow total x count N = 2*(sum of positive t solutions) + (1 if t=0 among solutions). Since t=0 only occurs when k=0 (i.e., either k1=0 or k2=0). In that case, t=0 contributes one x (0). Also t=20 is positive, contributes two x.\n\nThus we need to compute N based on which ks are valid.\n\nLet’s denote for each k, we have:\n- If k=0: t solutions: {0,20}. Positive t count =1 (t=20). t=0 present.\n- If 0<k<100: three t solutions: two in (0,20) (both positive), one >20 (positive). So positive t count =3, no zero.\n- If k=100: two t solutions: t=10 (positive), t≈24.14 (positive). Positive count=2.\n- If k>100: one t solution >20 positive. Positive count=1.\n\nThus we can compute contributions to N:\n\nFor a given k:\n- If k=0: contributes N_k = 2*1 +1 =3 (since t=20 gives two x, plus x=0). So N=3.\n- If 0<k<100: contributes N_k = 2*3 =6.\n- If k=100: contributes N_k = 2*2 =4.\n- If k>100: contributes N_k = 2*1 =2.\n\nNow total N = sum over valid ks (k1,k2) of N_k.\n\nWe need N=12.\n\nNow consider possibilities for c integer.\n\nWe need to consider cases where both k1 and k2 are ≥0, or only one is.\n\nCase A: Both k1 and k2 ≥0.\n\nThen N = N_{k1}+ N_{k2}.\n\nWe need sum =12.\n\nPossible combinations of N_k values (3,6,4,2) that sum to 12.\n\nList possibilities (order doesn't matter):\n\n- 6+6 =12\n- 6+4+2? but only two ks, so not.\n- 6+3+3? can't, only two ks.\n- 4+4+4? not.\n- 4+8? 8 not possible.\n- 2+10? 10 not possible.\n- 3+9? 9 not possible.\n- 3+6+3? not.\n\nThus only possible is both ks give N_k=6 each. So each must be in (0,100) (strict). So we need:\n\nk1 = c+21 ∈ (0,100) i.e., 0 < c+21 < 100 → -21 < c < 79.\n\nSimilarly k2 = c-21 ∈ (0,100) → 0 < c-21 < 100 → 21 < c < 121.\n\nIntersection of these intervals for c: need both conditions simultaneously.\n\nSo c must satisfy:\n\nc > -21 and c < 79, and c > 21 and c < 121.\n\nThus c > 21 and c < 79. So integer c in {22,23,...,78}. Count = 78-22+1 = 57.\n\nBut also need to ensure k1 and k2 are not equal to 0 or 100. Since we require strict inequality (0<k<100). At boundaries c such that k=0 or 100 would give different N_k.\n\nCheck boundaries:\n\nk1=0 => c = -21 (outside range). k1=100 => c = 79 (c=79 gives k1=100). But c must be <79, so c=78 max, fine.\n\nk2=0 => c=21 (c=21 gives k2=0). Not allowed because need >21. So c=22 min.\n\nk2=100 => c=121 (outside). So fine.\n\nThus for c from 22 to 78 inclusive, both ks are in (0,100). So N=12.\n\nNow need to also consider case where one of ks is negative (no solutions) and the other gives N=12.\n\nCase B: Only one of k1,k2 ≥0, the other negative.\n\nThen N = N_k for the nonnegative k, must equal 12.\n\nBut N_k can be at most 6 (when 0<k<100). So impossible. So both must be nonnegative.\n\nCase C: Both nonnegative but one maybe equals 0 or 100 leading to other N values.\n\nWe need sum N_k =12. Let's list possible N_k values: 3 (k=0), 4 (k=100), 6 (0<k<100), 2 (k>100).\n\nWe need two numbers from {2,3,4,6} summing to 12.\n\nPossibilities:\n- 6+6 =12 (already considered)\n- 6+4=10 no\n- 6+3=9\n- 6+2=8\n- 4+4=8\n- 4+3=7\n- 4+2=6\n- 3+3=6\n- 3+2=5\n- 2+2=4\n\nThus only 6+6 works. So both ks must be in (0,100). So our earlier result stands.\n\nThus integer c such that both c+21 and c-21 are in (0,100). That gave c ∈ (21,79) intersect integer => 22 to 78 inclusive.\n\nCount = 57.\n\nCheck also that c integer, yes.\n\nEdge cases: need to ensure that the total distinct real solutions are 12 distinct x. Are there any overlapping x from the two ks? Since ks are different (difference 42), the t solutions are distinct because f(t) cannot equal two different values. So no overlap. Also t=0 only occurs if k=0, which not the case. So distinctness holds.\n\nThus answer: 57.\n\nLet's craft final solution with reasoning.\nLet  \n\n\\[\nA(x)=\\bigl|\\,20|x|-x^{2}\\bigr| .\n\\]\n\nThe given equation  \n\n\\[\n\\bigl|A(x)-c\\bigr|=21\n\\]\n\nis equivalent to  \n\n\\[\nA(x)=c+21\\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad A(x)=c-21 .\n\\]\n\nHence we must count the real solutions of  \n\n\\[\nA(x)=k ,\\qquad k\\in\\{c+21,\\;c-21\\},\n\\]\n\nand require that the total number of distinct solutions be \\(12\\).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 1.

Notice that we want this to be equal to $c-21$ and $c+21$ .\n\nWe see that from left to right, the graph first dips from very positive to $0$ at $x=-20$ , then rebounds up to $100$ at $x=-10$ , then falls back down to $0$ at $x=0$ .\n\nThe positive $x$ are symmetric, so the graph re-ascends to $100$ at $x=10$ , falls back to $0$ at $x=10$ , and rises to arbitrarily large values afterwards.\n\nNow we analyze the $y$ (varied by $c$ ) values. At $y=k<0$ , we will have no solutions, as the line $y=k$ will have no intersections with our graph.\n\nAt $y=0$ , we will have exactly $3$ solutions for the three zeroes.\n\nAt $y=n$ for any $n$ strictly between $0$ and $100$ , we will have exactly $6$ solutions.\n\nAt $y=100$ , we will have $4$ solutions, because local maxima are reached at $x= \\pm 10$ .\n\nAt $y=m>100$ , we will have exactly $2$ solutions.\n\nTo get $12$ distinct solutions for $y=|20|x|-x^2|=c \\pm 21$ , both $c +21$ and $c-21$ must produce $6$ solutions.\n\nThus $0<c-21$ and $c+21<100$ , so $c \\in \\{ 22, 23, \\dots , 77, 78 \\}$ is required.\n\nIt is easy to verify that all of these choices of $c$ produce $12$ distinct solutions (none overlap), so our answer is $\\boxed{057}$ .\n\nSolution 3 (Graphing):\nLet $y = |x|.$ Then the equation becomes $\\left|\\left|20y-y^2\\right|-c\\right| = 21$ , or $\\left|y^2-20y\\right| = c \\pm 21$ . Note that since $y = |x|$ , $y$ is nonnegative, so we only care about nonnegative solutions in $y$ . Notice that each positive solution in $y$ gives two solutions in $x$ ( $x = \\pm y$ ), whereas if $y = 0$ is a solution, this only gives one solution in $x$ , $x = 0$ . Since the total number of solutions in $x$ is even, $y = 0$ must not be a solution. Hence, we require that $\\left|y^2-20y\\right| = c \\pm 21$ has exactly $6$ positive solutions and is not solved by $y = 0.$\n\nIf $c < 21$ , then $c - 21$ is negative, and therefore cannot be the absolute value of $y^2 - 20y$ . This means the equation's only solutions are in $\\left|y^2-20y\\right| = c + 21$ . There is no way for this equation to have $6$ solutions, since the quadratic $y^2-20y$ can only take on each of the two values $\\pm(c + 21)$ at most twice, yielding at most $4$ solutions. Hence, $c \\ge 21$ . $c$ also can't equal $21$ , since this would mean $y = 0$ would solve the equation. Hence, $c > 21.$\n\nAt this point, the equation $y^2-20y = c \\pm 21$ will always have exactly $2$ positive solutions, since $y^2-20y$ takes on each positive value exactly once when $y$ is restricted to positive values (graph it to see this), and $c \\pm 21$ are both positive. Therefore, we just need $y^2-20y = -(c \\pm 21)$ to have the remaining $4$ solutions exactly. This means the horizontal lines at $-(c \\pm 21)$ each intersect the parabola $y^2 - 20y$ in two places. This occurs when the two lines are above the parabola's vertex $(10,-100)$ . Hence we have \\begin{align*} -(c + 21) &> -100 \\\\ c + 21 &< 100 \\\\ c &< 79. \\end{align*} Hence, the integers $c$ satisfying the conditions are those satisfying $21 < c < 79.$ There are $\\boxed{057}$ such integers.\n\nNote: Be careful of counting at the end, you may mess up and get $59$ .\n\nSolution 4 (Algebra):\nRemoving the absolute value bars from the equation successively, we get \\begin{align*} \\left|\\left|20|x|-x^2\\right|-c\\right|&=21 \\\\ \\left|20|x|-x^2\\right|&= c \\pm21 \\\\ 20|x|-x^2 &= \\pm c \\pm 21 \\\\ x^2 \\pm 20x \\pm c \\pm21 &= 0. \\end{align*} The discriminant of this equation is \\[\\sqrt{400-4(\\pm c \\pm 21)}.\\] Equating the discriminant to $0$ , we see that there will be two distinct solutions to each of the possible quadratics above only in the interval $-79 < c < 79$ . However, the number of zeros the equation $ax^2+b|x|+k$ has is determined by where $ax^2+bx+k$ and $ax^2-bx+k$ intersect, namely at $(0,k)$ . When $k>0$ , $a>0$ , $ax^2+b|x|+k$ will have only $2$ solutions, and when $k<0$ , $a>0$ , then there will be $4$ real solutions, if they exist at all.\nIn order to have $12$ solutions here, we thus need to ensure $-c+21<0$ , so that exactly $2$ out of the $4$ possible equations of the form $ax^2+b|x|+k$ given above have y-intercepts below $0$ and only $2$ real solutions, while the remaining $2$ equations have $4$ solutions. This occurs when $c>21$ , so our final bounds are $21<c<79$ , giving us $\\boxed{057}$ valid values of $c$ ."}

Distance from point to line = perpendicular distance.\n\nWe need area K of trapezoid, then compute sqrt(2)*K.\n\nLet’s set coordinate system. Let’s place trapezoid with AB horizontal (base) at y=0 perhaps, and CD parallel above? Actually AB < CD, so longer base CD maybe bottom? Usually trapezoid with AB top shorter, CD bottom longer. Let's set CD as base on x-axis (y=0). Then AB is parallel line at y = h (height). So vertices: Let D = (0,0), C = (c,0) where c = CD length. Let A = (x0, h), B = (x0 + a, h) where a = AB length, and x0 is horizontal offset of top base relative to D. Since trapezoid is isosceles, legs AD and BC are equal length, which implies that the top base is centered: the offsets from each side are equal: x0 = (c - a)/2. Indeed for isosceles trapezoid, the legs are symmetric, so D to A is slanted left side, C to B right side. So coordinates: D (0,0), C (c,0), A ( (c - a)/2 , h ), B ( (c + a)/2 , h ). Then AD length = sqrt( ((c - a)/2)^2 + h^2 ). BC length = sqrt( ((c - a)/2)^2 + h^2 ) same.\n\nNow we have distances from A to lines BC, CD, BD.\n\nCompute line equations.\n\nFirst, line CD is x-axis y=0. Distance from A to CD is simply its y-coordinate h. Given distance = 18. So h = 18.\n\nGreat.\n\nNext, line BC: points B ( (c + a)/2 , 18 ), C (c,0). Compute distance from A to line BC = 15.\n\nLine BC vector: C - B = (c - (c + a)/2 , 0 - 18) = ( (2c - (c + a))/2 , -18 ) = ( (c - a)/2 , -18 ). So direction vector v = ( (c - a)/2 , -18 ). Normal vector n = (18, (c - a)/2 ) (swap and sign). Actually for line through B and C, distance from point A to line = |( (C - B) cross (A - B) )| / |C - B|. In 2D, cross product magnitude = |(x1*y2 - y1*x2)|.\n\nLet’s compute using formula.\n\nLet B = (xb, 18) where xb = (c + a)/2. Let C = (c,0). Vector v = C - B = (c - xb, -18) = (c - (c + a)/2, -18) = ((c - a)/2, -18). Good.\n\nVector w = A - B = (xa - xb, 0) because A y = 18 same as B, so w = (xa - xb, 0). Since A and B have same y, w is horizontal. xa = (c - a)/2. So xa - xb = (c - a)/2 - (c + a)/2 = -a. So w = (-a, 0).\n\nCross product magnitude (2D) = |v_x * w_y - v_y * w_x| = | ( (c - a)/2 ) * 0 - (-18) * (-a) | = | -18 * (-a) |? Wait compute: v_y = -18, w_x = -a. So -v_y * w_x? Actually formula: v_x w_y - v_y w_x = (c - a)/2 * 0 - (-18)*(-a) = - ( -18 * -a ) = - (18 a) = -18 a. Magnitude = 18 a.\n\nThus distance d = |cross| / |v| = 18 a / sqrt( ((c - a)/2)^2 + 18^2 ).\n\nGiven distance = 15.\n\nSo 18 a / sqrt( ((c - a)/2)^2 + 324 ) = 15.\n\n=> 18 a = 15 sqrt( ((c - a)/2)^2 + 324 ).\n\n=> Square both sides: 324 a^2 = 225 ( ((c - a)/2)^2 + 324 ).\n\n=> Divide 9: 36 a^2 = 25 ( ((c - a)/2)^2 + 324 ).\n\n=> Expand: 36 a^2 = 25 * ((c - a)^2 /4 + 324 ).\n\n=> Multiply: 36 a^2 = (25/4)(c - a)^2 + 25*324 = (25/4)(c - a)^2 + 8100.\n\n=> Multiply by 4: 144 a^2 = 25 (c - a)^2 + 32400.\n\n=> Rearr: 144 a^2 - 25 (c - a)^2 = 32400.\n\nEquation (1).\n\nNow distance from A to line BD is 10.\n\nLine BD: points B (xb,18) and D (0,0). Compute distance from A (xa,18) to line BD.\n\nVector u = D - B = (0 - xb, 0 - 18) = (-xb, -18). Vector from B to A: A - B = (xa - xb, 0) = (-a, 0) as before.\n\nCross product magnitude = |u_x * (A-B)_y - u_y * (A-B)_x| = | (-xb)*0 - (-18)*(-a) | = |- ( -18 * -a )| = |-18 a| = 18 a.\n\nNote same magnitude! Interesting.\n\nLength of u = sqrt( xb^2 + 18^2 ).\n\nThus distance = 18 a / sqrt( xb^2 + 324 ) = 10.\n\n=> 18 a = 10 sqrt( xb^2 + 324 ).\n\n=> Square: 324 a^2 = 100 ( xb^2 + 324 ).\n\n=> Divide 4: 81 a^2 = 25 ( xb^2 + 324 ).\n\n=> Expand: 81 a^2 = 25 xb^2 + 8100.\n\n=> Rearr: 81 a^2 - 25 xb^2 = 8100.\n\nRecall xb = (c + a)/2.\n\nThus xb^2 = (c + a)^2 /4.\n\nPlug: 81 a^2 - 25 * (c + a)^2 /4 = 8100.\n\nMultiply 4: 324 a^2 - 25 (c + a)^2 = 32400.\n\nEquation (2).\n\nNow we have two equations (1) and (2):\n\n(1): 144 a^2 - 25 (c - a)^2 = 32400.\n(2): 324 a^2 - 25 (c + a)^2 = 32400.\n\nWe can solve for a and c.\n\nLet’s expand both.\n\nLet’s denote.\n\nEquation (1): 144 a^2 - 25 (c^2 - 2ac + a^2) = 32400.\n=> 144 a^2 - 25 c^2 + 50 a c - 25 a^2 = 32400.\n=> (144 - 25) a^2 + 50 a c - 25 c^2 = 32400.\n=> 119 a^2 + 50 a c - 25 c^2 = 32400.   (Eq A)\n\nEquation (2): 324 a^2 - 25 (c^2 + 2ac + a^2) = 32400.\n=> 324 a^2 - 25 c^2 - 50 a c - 25 a^2 = 32400.\n=> (324 - 25) a^2 - 50 a c - 25 c^2 = 32400.\n=> 299 a^2 - 50 a c - 25 c^2 = 32400.   (Eq B)\n\nNow we have two equations linear in terms of a^2, ac, c^2.\n\nLet’s solve.\n\nLet’s treat unknowns: X = a^2, Y = ac, Z = c^2.\n\nEq A: 119 X + 50 Y - 25 Z = 32400.\nEq B: 299 X - 50 Y - 25 Z = 32400.\n\nAdd equations to eliminate Y:\n\n(119+299) X + (50-50) Y - 50 Z = 64800.\n=> 418 X - 50 Z = 64800.\n=> Divide 2: 209 X - 25 Z = 32400.   (Eq C)\n\nNow subtract Eq B from Eq A to eliminate Z maybe.\n\nEq A - Eq B: (119-299) X + (50 - (-50)) Y + (-25 - (-25)) Z = 0.\n=> -180 X + 100 Y + 0 Z = 0.\n=> 100 Y = 180 X.\n=> Y = (9/5) X. Since 180/100 = 9/5.\n\nThus ac = Y = (9/5) a^2 => c = (9/5) a.\n\nGreat! So c = (9/5) a.\n\nNow plug into Eq C: 209 X - 25 Z = 32400.\n\nBut Z = c^2 = (81/25) a^2 = (81/25) X.\n\nThus 209 X - 25 * (81/25) X = 32400 => 209 X - 81 X = 32400 => 128 X = 32400 => X = 32400 / 128 = simplify: divide by 8 => 4050 / 16 = divide by 2 => 2025 / 8 = 253.125? Let's compute exactly: 32400/128 = 253.125 = 2025/8.\n\nThus a^2 = 2025/8.\n\nSo a = sqrt(2025/8) = (45)/sqrt(8) = 45 / (2√2) = (45√2)/4? Wait sqrt(8)=2√2. So a = 45/(2√2) = (45√2)/4.\n\nNow c = (9/5) a = (9/5)*(45/(2√2)) = (405)/(10√2) = (81)/(2√2) = multiply numerator denominator: (81√2)/4.\n\nCheck: a = 45/(2√2) = (45√2)/4 ≈ 45*1.414/4 = 63.63/4 = 15.9075. c = (81)/(2√2) = (81√2)/4 ≈ 81*1.414/4 = 114.534/4 = 28.6335. So c > a, good.\n\nNow we have height h = 18.\n\nArea K of trapezoid = (1/2)*(sum of bases)*(height) = (1/2)*(a + c)*h.\n\nCompute a + c: a + c = 45/(2√2) + 81/(2√2) = (126)/(2√2) = 63/√2 = (63√2)/2.\n\nThus (a + c) = (63√2)/2.\n\nNow K = 0.5 * (63√2 /2) * 18 = (1/2)*(63√2/2)*18 = (63√2 * 18) /4 = (63*18 √2)/4.\n\nCompute 63*18 = 1134. So K = 1134 √2 /4 = simplify divide by 2: 567 √2 /2.\n\nThus K = (567/2) √2.\n\nNow we need sqrt(2) * K = √2 * K = √2 * (567/2) √2 = (567/2) * 2 = 567.\n\nThus answer is 567.\n\nCheck calculations.\n\nLet's verify distances to ensure consistency.\n\nCompute a = 45/(2√2) ≈ 15.909, c ≈ 28.636, h=18.\n\nCompute distance from A to line BC: earlier formula gave 18 a / sqrt( ((c - a)/2)^2 + 324 ). Compute (c - a)/2 = (28.636 - 15.909)/2 = 12.727/2 = 6.3635. Square: 40.5 approx. Add 324 => 364.5. sqrt ≈ 19.094. 18 a = 18*15.909 = 286.36. Divide => 286.36/19.094 = 15.0 approx. Good.\n\nDistance to BD: xb = (c + a)/2 = (28.636+15.909)/2 = 44.545/2 = 22.2725. xb^2 ≈ 496.1. Add 324 => 820.1 sqrt ≈ 28.639. 18 a = 286.36 /28.639 = 10.0 approx. Good.\n\nThus consistent.\n\nThus final answer 567.\n\nNow produce final solution with steps.\nLet  \n\n\\[\nAB\\parallel CD ,\\qquad AB<a,\\; CD=c ,\\qquad h=\\text{height of the trapezoid}.\n\\]\n\nPlace the trapezoid in a coordinate system with  \n\n\\[\nD=(0,0),\\qquad C=(c,0),\\qquad \nA=\\Bigl(\\frac{c-a}{2},\\,h\\Bigr),\\qquad \nB=\\Bigl(\\frac{c+a}{2},\\,h\\Bigr)\n\\]\n\n(the trapezoid is isosceles, so the top base is centred).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 1.

Then, notice that since $ABCD$ is isosceles, $\\Delta ABD \\cong \\Delta BAC$ , and the length of the altitude from $B$ to $AC$ is also $10$ . Let the foot of this altitude be $F$ , and let the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$ be denoted as $E$ . Then, $\\Delta BCF \\sim \\Delta ACE$ . So, $\\frac{BC}{AC} = \\frac{BF}{AE} = \\frac{2}{3}$ . Now, notice that $[ABC] = \\frac{10 \\cdot AC} {2} = \\frac{AB \\cdot 18}{2} \\implies AC = \\frac{9 \\cdot AB}{5}$ , where $[ABC]$ denotes the area of triangle $ABC$ . Letting $AB = x$ , this equality becomes $AC = \\frac{9x}{5}$ . Also, from $\\frac{BC}{AC} = \\frac{2}{3}$ , we have $BC = \\frac{6x}{5}$ . Now, by the Pythagorean theorem on triangles $ABF$ and $CBF$ , we have $AF = \\sqrt{x^{2}-100}$ and $CF = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{6x}{5} \\right) ^{2}-100}$ . Notice that $AC = AF + CF$ , so $\\frac{9x}{5} = \\sqrt{x^{2}-100} + \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{6x}{5} \\right) ^{2}-100}$ . Squaring both sides of the equation once, moving $x^{2}-100$ and $\\left( \\frac{6x}{5} \\right) ^{2}-100$ to the right, dividing both sides by $2$ , and squaring the equation once more, we are left with $\\frac{32x^{4}}{25} = 324x^{2}$ . Dividing both sides by $x^{2}$ (since we know $x$ is positive), we are left with $\\frac{32x^{2}}{25} = 324$ . Solving for $x$ gives us $x = \\frac{45}{2\\sqrt{2}}$ .\n\nNow, let the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $CD$ be $G$ . Then let $DG = y$ . Let the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $CD$ be $H$ . Then, $CH$ is also equal to $y$ . Notice that $ABHG$ is a rectangle, so $GH = x$ . Now, we have $CG = GH + CH = x + y$ . By the Pythagorean theorem applied to $\\Delta AGC$ , we have $(x+y)^{2}+18^{2}= \\left( \\frac{9x}{5} \\right) ^{2}$ . We know that $\\frac{9x}{5} = \\frac{9}{5} \\cdot \\frac{45}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{81}{2\\sqrt{2}}$ , so we can plug this into this equation. Solving for $x+y$ , we get $x+y=\\frac{63}{2\\sqrt{2}}$ .\n\nFinally, to find $[ABCD]$ , we use the formula for the area of a trapezoid: $K = [ABCD] = \\frac{b_{1}+b_{2}}{2} \\cdot h = \\frac{AB+CD}{2} \\cdot 18 = \\frac{x+(CG+DG)}{2} \\cdot 18 = \\frac{2x+2y}{2} \\cdot 18 = (x+y) \\cdot 18 = \\frac{63}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot 18 = \\frac{567}{\\sqrt{2}}$ . The problem asks us for $K \\cdot \\sqrt{2}$ , which comes out to be $\\boxed{567}$ .\n\n~advanture\n\nSolution 3 (Similar Triangles and Pythagorean Theorem):\nMake $AE$ perpendicular to $BC$ ; $AG$ perpendicular to $BD$ ; $AF$ perpendicular $DC$ .\n\nIt's obvious that $\\triangle{AEB} \\sim \\triangle{AFD}$ . Let $EB=5x; AB=5y; DF=6x; AD=6y$ . Then make $BQ$ perpendicular to $DC$ , it's easy to get $BQ=18$ .\n\nSince $AB$ parallel to $DC$ , $\\angle{ABG}=\\angle{BDQ}$ , so $\\triangle{ABG} \\sim \\triangle{BDQ}$ . After drawing the altitude, it's obvious that $FQ=AB=5y$ , so $DQ=5y+6x$ . According to the property of similar triangles, $AG/BQ=BG/DQ$ . So, $\\frac{5}{9}=\\frac{GB}{(6x+5y)}$ , or $GB=\\frac{(30x+25y)}{9}$ .\n\nNow, we see the $\\triangle AEB$ , pretty easy to find that $15^2+(5x)^2=(5y)^2$ , then we get $x^2+9=y^2$ , then express $y$ into $x$ form that $y=\\sqrt{x^2+9}$ we put the length of $BG$ back to $\\triangle AGB$ : $BG^2+100=AB^2$ . So, \\[\\frac{[30x+25\\sqrt{(x^2+9)}]^2}{81}+100=(5\\sqrt{x^2+9})^2.\\] After calculating, we can have a final equation of $x^2+9=\\sqrt{x^2+9}\\cdot3x$ . It's easy to find $x=\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ then $y=\\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ .

As $\\angle QAB = 90^\\circ$ , we have that $\\angle QAR = 90^\\circ - \\angle RAB =\\angle ABR = \\angle APR = \\angle APQ$ , with the last equality coming from cyclic quadrilateral $APBR$ . Thus, $\\triangle QAR \\sim \\triangle QPA$ and we have that $\\frac{AQ}{AR} = \\frac{PQ}{PA}$ or that $\\frac{18}{10} = \\frac{QP}{15}$ , which we can see gives us that $QP = 27$ . Further ratios using the same similar triangles gives that $QR = 12$ and $RP = 15$ .\n\nWe also see that quadrilaterals $APBR$ and $ARQD$ are both cyclic,it is clear that $\\angle AQR =\\angle ADR$ and $\\angle APR =\\angle ABR$ ,which shows $\\triangle ABD \\sim \\triangle APQ$ . we wish to find the ratio of similitude between the two triangles.\n\nTo do this, we use the one number we have for $\\triangle ABD$ : we know that the altitude from $A$ to $BD$ has length $10$ . As the two triangles are similar, if we can find the height from $A$ to $PQ$ , we can take the ratio of the two heights as the ratio of similitude. To do this, we once again note that $QP = 27$ . Using this, we can drop the altitude from $A$ to $QP$ and let it intersect $QP$ at $H$ . Then, let $QH = x$ and thus $HP=27-x$ . We then have by the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle AQH$ and $\\triangle APH$ : \\begin{align*} 18^2 - x^2 &= 15^2 - (27-x)^2 \\\\ 324 - x^2 &= 225 - (x^2-54x+729) \\\\ 54x &= 828 \\\\ x &= \\frac{46}{3}. \\end{align*} Then, $RH = QH - QR = \\frac{46}{3} - 12 = \\frac{10}{3}$ . This gives us then from right triangle $\\triangle ARH$ that $AH = \\frac{20\\sqrt{2}}{3}$ and thus the ratio of $\\triangle APQ$ to $\\triangle ABD$ is $\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ . From this, we see then that \\[AB = AP \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} = 15 \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\] and \\[AD = AQ \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} = 18 \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{27\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\\] The Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle AQD$ then gives that \\[QD = \\sqrt{AD^2 - AQ^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{27\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2 - 18^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{81}{2}} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\\] Then, we have the height of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $AQ = 18$ , the top base is $AB = \\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ , and the bottom base is $CD = \\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4} + 2\\cdot\\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . From the equation of a trapezoid, $K = \\frac{b_1+b_2}{2} \\cdot h = \\frac{63\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\cdot 18 = \\frac{567\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ , so the answer is $K\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{567}$ .\n\n~lvmath\n\n~Corrected by dongjiu0728(Former Ans made the wrong QH and wrong QR、RP but somehow came to the right answer,which trapped me for a weekend)\n\nSolution 5 (Cyclic Quadrilaterals, Similar Triangles, Pythagorean Theorem):\nLet $E,F,$ and $G$ be the feet of the altitudes from $A$ to $BC,CD,$ and $DB$ , respectively.\n\nClaim: We have $2$ pairs of similar right triangles: $\\triangle AEB \\sim \\triangle AFD$ and $\\triangle AGD \\sim \\triangle AEC$ .\n\nProof: Note that $ABCD$ is cyclic. We need one more angle, and we get this from this cyclic quadrilateral: \\begin{align*} \\angle ABE &= 180^\\circ - \\angle ABC =\\angle ADC = \\angle ADG, \\\\ \\angle ADG &= \\angle ADB =\\angle ACB = \\angle ACE. \\hspace{20mm} \\square \\end{align*} Let $AD=a$ . We obtain from the similarities $AB = \\frac{5a}{6}$ and $AC=BD=\\frac{3a}{2}$ .\n\nBy Ptolemy, $\\left(\\frac{3a}{2}\\right)^2 = a^2 + \\frac{5a}{6} \\cdot CD$ , so $\\frac{5a^2}{4} = \\frac{5a}{6} \\cdot CD$ .\n\nWe obtain $CD=\\frac{3a}{2}$ , so $DF=\\frac{CD-AB}{2}=\\frac{a}{3}$ .\n\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem on $\\triangle ADF$ , we get $324=a^2 - \\frac{a^2}{9}=\\frac{8a^2}{9}$ .\n\nThus, $a=\\frac{27}{\\sqrt{2}}$ , and $[ABCD]=\\frac{AB+CD}{2} \\cdot 18 = \\frac{\\frac{5a}{6} +\\frac{9a}{6}}{2} \\cdot 18 = 18 \\cdot \\frac{7}{6} \\cdot \\frac{27}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{567}{\\sqrt{2}}$ , yielding $\\sqrt2\\cdot[ABCD]=\\boxed{567}$ .\n\nSolution 6 (Similar Triangles and Trigonometry):\nLet $AD=BC=a$ . Draw diagonal $AC$ and let $G$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$ , $F$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to line $BC$ , and $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $DC$ .\n\nNote that $\\triangle CBG\\sim\\triangle CAF$ , and we get that $\\frac{10}{15}=\\frac{a}{AC}$ . Therefore, $AC=\\frac32 a$ . It then follows that $\\triangle ABF\\sim\\triangle ADH$ . Using similar triangles, we can then find that $AB=\\frac{5}{6}a$ . Using the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle ABC$ , We can find that the $\\cos\\angle ABC=-\\frac{1}{3}$ . Since $\\angle ABF=\\angle ADH$ , and each is supplementary to $\\angle ABC$ , we know that the $\\cos\\angle ADH=\\frac{1}{3}$ . It then follows that $a=\\frac{27\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . Then it can be found that the area $K$ is $\\frac{567\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . Multiplying this by $\\sqrt{2}$ , the answer is $\\boxed{567}$ .\n\n~happykeeper\n\nSolution 7 (Similar Triangles and Trigonometry):\nDraw the distances in terms of $B$ , as shown in the diagram. By similar triangles, $\\triangle{AEC}\\sim\\triangle{BIC}$ . As a result, let $AB=u$ , then $BC=AD=\\frac{6}{5}u$ and $2AC=3BC$ . The triangle $ABC$ is $6-5-9$ which $\\cos(\\angle{ABC})=-\\frac{1}{3}$ . By angle subtraction, $\\cos(180-\\theta)=-\\cos\\theta$ . Therefore, $AB=\\frac{45}{2\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{45\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ and $AD=BC=\\frac{27}{\\sqrt{2}}$ .
