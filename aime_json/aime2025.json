If we just take $y = x$ and $x = 34y^2$ , we see that the sum of all $y$ by Vieta's is just $\\frac{1}{34}$ . Similarly, for $y = x + 4$ , the sum of the roots by Vieta's is also $\\frac{1}{34}$ . So for all the positive slope lines intersecting with the parabola just gives the sum of all $y$ to continuously be $\\frac{1}{34}$ . Okay, now let's look at the negative slope lines. These will have equations of $y = 2 - x, y = 6 - x, y = 10 - x, ..., y = 34 - x, ...$ . Similar to what we did above, we just set each of these equations along with the parabola $x = 34y^2$ . The sum of all $y$ for each of these negative line intersections by Vieta's is $\\frac{-1}{34}$ . This keeps going for all of the lines until we reach $y = 34 - x$ . Now, unfortunately, both solutions don't work as the negative solution is out of the range of [1 , 3], [5, 7] and so on. So we just need to take one solution for this and that being the positive one according to the graph. So we just need to solve $34 - y = 34y^2$ which means $34y^2 + y - 34 = 0$ . Solving gives \\[y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{68^2 + 1}}{68} = \\frac{-1 + 5 \\sqrt{185}}{68}.\\] So, the sums of the roots are $\\frac{1}{34}$ + $\\frac{-1}{34}$ + $\\frac{1}{34}$ + .... + $\\frac{-1}{34}$ + $\\frac{1}{34}$ + $\\frac{-1 + 5 \\sqrt{185}}{68}.$ Nicely all the $\\frac{1}{34}$ terms cancel out leaving with only one $\\frac{1}{34}$ and $\\frac{-1 + 5 \\sqrt{185}}{68}.$ So the sum of these two is $\\frac{1 + 5 \\sqrt{185}}{68}.$ From there, the answer is $\\boxed{259}$ .\n\n~ilikemath247365"

Consider some valid $x,y,z$ that satisfy $x+y+z=75$ and $x>-1>z>y$ . We can infinitely increase $x$ while decreasing $y$ by the same amount, leading to another valid triple, so this case is infinite and we do not consider this case (for instance, if $x=100,y=-13,z=-12$ , then $x=100+a,y=-13-a,z=-12$ is a valid triple for all nonnegative $a$ ).\n\n2.

We consider edge cases, so we maximize each variable by the largest amount possible to find three triples $(77,-1,-1),(38,38,-1),(25,25,25)$ . We assume that these are the only edge cases (so the figure forms a triangle), and we can use the Distance formula .

The segment starts in a region, and for each intersection, it will enter another region, so the number of regions a segment passes through is $1$ more than the number of intersections with the axes and other segments. Thus, we have that by linearity of expectation the expected number of new regions created by adding a segment is \\[\\dfrac{17}{36}\\cdot(\\text{number of segments already added})+\\dfrac{4}{3}+1,\\] so the number of new regions added in total by $25$ segments again by linearity of expectation is \\[\\sum_{k=0}^{24}\\left(\\dfrac{17}{36}k+\\dfrac{7}{3}\\right)=\\dfrac{17}{36}\\cdot \\dfrac{24\\cdot 25}{2}+\\dfrac{25\\cdot 7}{3}\\] which simplifies to $200$ as the expected number of new regions added by the $25$ segments.

Note that $AX+CX+DX$ is minimized at this point when $\\angle AXC=\\angle CXD=\\angle AXD=120^{\\circ}$ .

Then it turns out that we actually have $\\angle BXE=90^{\\circ}+90^{\\circ}=180^{\\circ}$ , implying that $B$ , $X$ and $E$ are collinear.

Additionally, $\\angle CXD=120^{\\circ}$ , so $CPDX$ is cyclic. Applying Ptolemy's Theorem, we have that $(CX)(PD)+(CP)(XD)=(XP)(CD)$ . But since $\\triangle CPD$ is equilateral, it follows that $CX+DX=PX$ . Then $AX+CX+DX=AX+PX=AP$ , so we wish to find $AP$ .

Then $a', b', c' \\leq 3^{5}$ and $3^{7} \\mid 3^{3}(a'^{3} + b'^{3} + c'^{3})$ . So $3^{4} \\mid a'^{3} + b'^{3} + c'^{3}$ . Then we need to choose another class so we choose class (1) again. Then $a = 3a''$ and the other homogeneously. Then $a'', b'', c'' \\leq 3^{4}$ and $3 \\mid a''^{3} + b''^{3} + c''^{3}$ . If we choose class (1) again, we would have satisfied the inequality and it would just be a number of multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $81$ so $27^{3} = 3^{9}$ triples. Then we choose class (2) to get the number of numbers that are 1(mod 3) between $1$ and $81$ which is also $27^{3} = 3^{9}$ . In fact, we would just have $3^{9}$ triples for each of the classes so $9(3^{9}) = 3^{11}$ triples for this case for (1)-(1) classes.\n\nNow, if we choose class (1) again, then we would have $3^{4} \\mid a'^{3} + b'^{3} + c'^{3}$ and $a', b', c' \\leq 3^{5}$ . But if we choose class (2) this time, then we would have $a' = 3a'' + 1$ and the others. Then $a'', b'', c'' \\leq 80$ . If we expand and simplify, we would have $3^{3}$ divides a number that is 1(mod 3) which is clearly impossible. Same thing for (1)-(3) class arrangement. So we can skip to (1)-(4) class.\n\nSo we start with $3^{4} \\mid a'^{3} + b'^{3} + c'^{3}$ and $a', b', c' \\leq 3^{5}$ . Choosing class (4) gives $a' = 3a'', b' = 3b'' + 1, c' = 3c'' - 1$ . Expanding and simplifying we would need $3^{2} \\mid a''^{3} + b''^{3} + c''^{3} + b''^{2} - c''^{2} + b'' + c''$ . Now, we would just need to do all $a'', b'', c''$ residues modular 3 such that 3 divides the expression. We can classify them as:\n\n$a,b,c \\equiv 0\\mod 3$\n\n$a,c \\equiv 0\\mod 3, b \\equiv 1\\mod 3$\n\n$a \\equiv 0\\mod 3, b \\equiv 1\\mod 3, c \\equiv 2\\mod 3$\n\n$a \\equiv 0\\mod 3, b \\equiv 2\\mod 3, c \\equiv 1\\mod 3$\n\n$a,b \\equiv 0\\mod 3, c \\equiv 2\\mod 3$\n\n$a \\equiv 1\\mod 3, b \\equiv 2\\mod 3, c \\equiv 0\\mod 3$\n\n$a \\equiv 1\\mod 3, b,c \\equiv 2\\mod 3$\n\n$a \\equiv 2\\mod 3, b \\equiv 0\\mod 3, c \\equiv 1\\mod 3$\n\n$a \\equiv 2\\mod 3, b,c \\equiv 1\\mod 3$\n\nIf we consider the first case, then we have $a'' = 3a'''$ and the others. Notice $1 \\leq a''' \\leq 27, 0 \\leq b''' \\leq 26, 1 \\leq c''' \\leq 27$ . If we simplify with this knowledge and plug it into the original expression, we just need $3 \\mid b''' + c'''$ . Then, we would have $b''', c''' \\equiv 0\\mod 3$ to get $9(9) = 3^{4}$ solutions. We can keep going for $b''' \\equiv 1\\mod 3$ and $c''' \\equiv 2\\mod 3$ to get another $9(9) = 3^{4}$ solutions. In total, we have $3(3^{4}) = 3^{5}$ solutions after considering all $b'''$ and $c'''$ residues mod 3. But the value of $a'''$ doesn't matter so that generates another $27 = 3^{3}$ solutions. In total, we have $3^{3} \\cdot 3^{5} = 3^{8}$ solutions. Now, we move on to the next case. Choosing this case will give that $a'' = 3a''', b'' = 3b''' + 1, c'' = 3c'''$ where $1 \\leq a''' \\leq 27, 0 \\leq b''' \\leq 26, 1 \\leq c''' \\leq 27$ . So we need $3^{2} \\mid 3^{3} a'''^{3} + 3^{3} b'''^{3} + 3^{3} b'''^{2} + 3^{2} b''' + 1 + 3^{3} c'''^{3} + 3^{2} b'''^{2} + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot b''' + 1 - 3^{2} c'''^{2} + 3b''' + 1 + 3c'''$ . Then simplifying gives $3^{2} \\mid 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot b''' + 3 + 3b''' + c'''$ . This yields $3 \\mid 2b''' + 1 + b''' + c'''$ which gives $3 \\mid c''' + 1$ so $c''' \\equiv 2\\mod 3$ . So $a'''$ and $b'''$ don't really matter for this case so we have $27(27) = 3^{6}$ possible pairs for $a''', b'''$ . Then we need to count the number of numbers that are 2(mod 3) between 1 and 27 inclusive which is 9. So we have $9(3^{6}) = 3^{8}$ total triples for case 2. The next case yields $3^{9}$ solutions following similar logic. In fact, all the remaining classes each give $3^{8}$ solutions for a total of $8(3^{8}) + 3^{9} = 11 \\cdot 3^{8}$ . But this is just for the class (1)-(4). Since classes (5),...,(9) are the same thing except it is just permutations of class (4), we will still generate the same number of solutions as (1)-(4) arrangement. So we would have $6$ classes each giving $11(3^{8})$ solutions for a total of $22(3^{9})$ solutions.\n\nSo we have completed all class (1) cases. Now we proceed to class (2). So if we start with class (2), then we have $a = 3a' + 1$ and homogeneously the others. Then, we have $3^{6} \\mid 3^{2}(a'^{3} + b'^{3} + c'^{3}) + 3^{2}(a'^{2} + b'^{2} + c'^{2}) + 3(a' + b' + c') + 1$ which is clearly impossible the $RHS$ expression is 1(mod 3). So we cannot begin with class (2). Similarly, we cannot begin with class (3). So we must proceed to class (4).\n\nStarting with class (4) gives us that $a = 3a', b = 3b' + 1, c = 3c' - 1$ . So $a', c' \\leq 3^{5}$ and $b' \\leq 242$ . We would get $3^{5} \\mid 3(a'^{3} + b'^{3} + c'^{3}) + 3(b'^{2} - c'^{2}) + b' + c'$ . So we need $3 \\mid b' + c'$ at first. Following our logic by building on residues mod 3, we have:\n\n$b', c' \\equiv 0\\mod 3$\n\n$b' \\equiv 1\\mod 3, c' \\equiv 2\\mod 3$\n\n$b' \\equiv 2\\mod 3, c' \\equiv 1\\mod 3$\n\nFollowing case 1, we have $b' = 3b'', c' = 3c''$ . This part in essence is basically all the casework bash we did for class (1) arrangements except this time, the powers of 3 are higher. We have to substitute and consider classes mod 3 yet again(I won't go through all the steps here because it's pretty much similar to how we found the above cases). We end with $3^{9}$ total cases. This would happen for all classes (4),...,(9) so we have to multiply this by 6 to get $6 \\cdot 3^{9}$ cases. The casework we did here was based on (4)-(5) class arrangements, I didn't actually consider (4)-{(1),(2),(3)} class arrangements. Doing the casework for all those classes, we end up with $8(3^{9})$ cases(I won't repeat the steps here because it's practically the same thing, bashing all modular residues mod 3. Essentially we would get another copy of the $6(3^{9})$ and then doing the casework for (4)-(2) and (4)-(3), we would get $6(3^{8})$ options for a total of $8(3^{9})$ triples). Thus, we actually have $6(3^{9}) + 8(3^{9}) = 14(3^{9})$ total cases for these subclasses. And finally, we are ready to add these all up.\n\nWe have $3^{11}$ total from class (1) trivial arrangements. Then, we have $22(3^{9})$ total cases from the (1)-(4) arrangements e.t.c. And finally, we have $14(3^{9})$ cases from the (4)-{(5)...(9)} classes. We have $3^{11} + 22(3^{9}) + 14(3^{9}) = 3^{11} + 36(3^{9}) = 3^{11} + 4(3^{11}) = 5(3^{11})$ . We can calculate this mod 1000 by simply noting $3^{10} \\equiv 49\\mod 1000$ because $3^{10} \\equiv 243^{2}\\mod 1000$ which tells us that the answer is just $5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 49 = \\boxed{735}$ .\n\n~ilikemath247365"

        "content": "Notice that we can treat each chair as an empty space. If a person selects a chair, we fill in the corresponding space with a ' $1$ ': otherwise, we fill in the corresponding space with a ' $0$ '. Since no person can sit to two other people (and two other people means having a person to your left and your right), that means that we can't have three people sitting in a row). So now the problem boils down to the following: we have a string of $0$ 's and $1$ 's of length $16$ , $8$ of which will be $1$ and $8$ of which will be $0$ . This string cannot have three consecutive $1$ 's in a row. We need to find the number of ways to construct this string.\n\nLet's try recursion. The motivation for recursion is that $16$ and $8$ are relatively big numbers (the upper bound is $16$ choose $8$ which is over $12000$ !) Also, many problems involving strings and counting with restrictions like 'three in a row' can usually be solved by breaking it up into smaller problems.\n\nDefine $S(n,k)$ to be the number of ways to create a string of length $n$ with $k$ $1$ 's and $n-k$ $0$ 's such that we can't have three consecutive $1$ 's. We need to find $S(16,8)$ .\n\nSo now we're going to take our recursive step, which usually involves splitting the string into two smaller strings. Suppose we split the string into two strings of length $n-b$ and $b$ . Also suppose that in the string of length $b$ there are $i$ $1$ 's (which means that in the string of length $n-b$ , there are $k-i$ $1$ 's. Now consider the first two digits in the string of length $b$ : we do casework on them.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1: 00}$\n\nIn this case, we can imagine the string as _ _ _ _ ... _ _ | 0 0 _ _ ... _ _ where the vertical line | shows the split. To the left of the split, we can choose the string without constraints in $S(n-b, k-i)$ ways since there are $n-b$ spaces and $k-i$ $1$ 's to place there. To the right of the $0$ , there are $b-2$ spaces and we still have to place $i$ $1's$ , so this can be done in $S(b-2,i)$ ways. Now choosing the left string and the right string are independent, so the number of ways in this case is \\[S(n-b, k-i)S(b-2, i)\\] .\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2: 01}$\n\nNow the split string looks something like _ _ _ _ ... _ _ | 0 1 _ _ ... _ _ . The number of ways to choose the string to the left remains unchanged: $S(n-b, k-i)$ ways. Similarly, it would seem that the number of ways to choose the remainder of the string on the right is $S(b-2, i-1)$ (just as in the previous case but we've used up one of the $i$ $1$ 's already). However we're overcounting, since if the remainder of the string on the right starts with 1 1 0 _ _ ... it makes a valid string by itself, but together with the 0 1 at the start, it makes 0 1 1 1 0, which is not allowed. Therefore we subtract the number of ways that we start with 0 1 1 1 0: there are $b-5$ spaces left and $i-3$ $1$ 's left to allocate, so we subtract $S(b-5, i-3)$ . So the total in this case is \\[S(n-b,k-i) \\cdot (S(b-2, i-1)-S(b-5, i-3))\\]\n\n$\\textbf{Case 3: 10}$\n\nNow the split string looks something like _ _ _ _ ... _ _ | 1 0 _ _ ... _ _ . Now the number of ways to fill in the empty slots to the right is unconstrained as it's following a $0$ : there are $b-2$ spaces and $i-1$ $1$ 's to allocate, so this gives $S(b-2, i-1)$ ways. Now for the left, we overcount just like in the previous case: filling $k-i$ $1$ 's in $n-b$ slots can be done in $S(n-b, k-i)$ ways. However any way ending with 0 1 1 violates the three $1$ 's in a row rule since in the center we have 0 1 1 1 0. The number of violations is the number of ways to fill in the empty slots to the left of _ _ _ ... _ _ 0 1 1 |, which can be done in $S(n-b-3, k-i-2)$ ways since we've already allocated $2$ $1$ 's and used up $3$ spaces. Therefore the total in this case is:\n\n\\[S(b-2, i-1) \\cdot (S(n-b, k-i)-S(n-b-3, k-i-2))\\]\n\n$\\textbf{Case 4: 11}$\n\nIn this case, we have something like _ _ _ _ ... _ _ | 1 1 _ _ ... _ _ . Since we can't have three $1$ 's in a row, we can automatically fill $0$ 's in: _ _ _ _ ... _ 0 | 1 1 0 _ ... _ _ . Now the number of ways to fill in the spaces on the left is $S(n-b-1, k-i)$ and the number of ways to fill in the spaces on the right is $S(b-3, i-2)$ . So the number of ways for this case is\n\n\\[S(n-b-1,k-i)S(b-3,i-2)\\]\n\nNow that we've finished casework, note that $i$ can be anything: at minimum $i$ can be zero, meaning that the string on the right has $0$ $1$ 's, and at maximum $i$ can be $b$ : the string is filled with $1$ 's. To encapsulate all of the cases of $i$ , we sum over the values of $i$ :\n\n\\[S(n,k) = \\sum_{i = 0}^{b} S(n-b, k-i)S(b-2, i) + S(n-b,k-i) \\cdot (S(b-2, i-1)-S(b-5, i-3))\\] \\[+ S(b-2, i-1) \\cdot (S(n-b, k-i)-S(n-b-3, k-i-2)) + S(n-b-1,k-i)S(b-3,i-2)\\]\n\nThis is our recurrence relationship. But where do we make the split? The above formula works for any $b$ , but if we make the split too close to the end, we could end up having to make lots of computations: if we split the string into $15$ and $1$ , we'll have to compute $S(15,8)$ , $S(14,8)$ , etc. which could end up being a lot of work. We want to choose the best $b$ to minimize the number of computations to save time. If we split the string unequally, one side will be larger and that side will require more computations. Therefore, we split the string in half so we just need to compute values of $n$ less than $8$ .\n\nSo suppose $b = 8$ and plug in $n=16$ , $k=8$ . Then the above recurrence relation becomes\n\n\\[S(16,8) = \\sum_{i = 0}^{8} S(8, 8-i)S(6, i) + S(8,8-i) \\cdot (S(6, i-1)-S(3, i-3))\\] \\[+ S(6, i-1) \\cdot (S(8, 8-i)-S(5, 6-i)) + S(7,8-i)S(5,i-2)\\]\n\nBefore we start with computations, let's state our base cases for recursion. Note that if $n<0$ and $k = 0$ , $S(n,k) = 1$ . Otherwise if $n<0$ or $k<0$ or $k>n$ , $S(n,k) = 0$ . Also, $S(x,0) = 1$ , $S(x,1) = x$ , $S(x,2) = \\binom{x}{2}$ , $S(x,3) = \\binom{x}{3}-x+2$ (the last one subtracting $x-2$ for the number of three $1$ 's in a row possible). Finally, for other cases of $S(n,k)$ we don't want to use the earlier large recursive formula since we'll have to break those into many small components. Instead, we modify the formula so that $b=2$ . This should be fine as $n$ has already been broken down to at most $8$ , so these computations shouldn't balloon. Using $b=2$ , we get $S(n,k) = S(n-2,k) + 2S(n-2,k-1) - S(n-5,k-3)+S(n-3,k-2)$ .\n\nLet's start the computation through the earlier cases.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1}$\n\n\\[\\sum_{i = 0}^{8} S(8,8-i)S(6,i) = \\sum_{i = 2}^{4} S(8,8-i)S(6,i)\\]\n\nThis is because for $i = 5$ , $S(6,5) = 0$ since the best we can do without three in a row is 1 1 0 1 1 0, which is four $1$ 's, and it's impossible to achieve $5$ $1$ 's without three back to back. Also if $i=5$ makes $S(6,i)$ $0$ , then $i \\geq 5$ makes $S(6,i)$ $0$ . Similarly we can't fit $7$ $1$ 's in $8$ slots without three back-to-back, so $i$ can't be $0$ or $1$ . So $i$ must go from $2$ to $4$ . In future cases, I'll skip the explanation of why we tighten our bounds on $i$ since the reasoning is the same as here.\n\n\\[\\implies \\sum_{i = 0}^{8} S(8,8-i)S(6,i) = S(8,6)S(6,2) + S(8,5)S(6,3) + S(8,4)S(6,4)\\]\n\nApplying the modified recurrence relation for $b=2$ , $S(8,6) = S(6,6) + 2S(6,5)-S(3,3)+S(5,4) = 0+0-0+S(5,4)$ $= S(3,4)+2S(3,3)-S(0,1)+S(2,2) = 0+0-0+1 = 1$ . Let's remember these for future computations: $S(8,6) = S(5,4) = 1$ .\n\n$S(8,5) = S(6,5)+2S(6,4)-S(3,2)+S(5,3) = 0+2S(6,4)-3+7$ . $S(6,4) = S(4,4) + 2S(4,3)-S(1,1)+S(3,2) = 0+2 \\cdot 2 - 1 + 3 = 6 \\implies S(8,5) = 2 \\cdot 6 + 4 = 16$ . We'll remember $S(6,4) = 6$ , $S(8,5) = 16$ .\n\nLastly $S(8,4) = S(6,4) + 2S(6,3)-S(3,1)+S(5,2) = 6+2 \\cdot 16 - 3 + 10 = 45$\n\nTherefore \\[\\sum_{i = 0}^{8} S(8,8-i)S(6,i) = S(8,6)S(6,2) + S(8,5)S(6,3) + S(8,4)S(6,4)\\] \\[= 1 \\cdot 15 + 16 \\cdot 16 + 45 \\cdot 6 = 541\\]\n\n$\\textbf{Cases 2 and 3}$\n\nRewrite \\[\\sum_{i = 0}^{8} S(8,8-i) \\cdot (S(6, i-1)-S(3, i-3)) + S(6, i-1) \\cdot (S(8, 8-i)-S(5, 6-i))\\] \\[= \\sum_{i = 0}^{8} 2S(8,8-i)S(6,i-1) - S(8,8-i)S(3,i-3) - S(6,i-1)S(5,6-i)\\] \\[= 2 \\sum_{i=2}^{5} S(8,8-i)S(6,i-1) - \\sum_{i=3}^{5} S(8,8-i)S(3,i-3) - \\sum_{i=2}^{5} S(6,i-1)S(5,6-i)\\]\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2 and 3 a.}$\n\n\\[\\sum_{i=2}^{5} S(8,8-i)S(6,i-1) = S(8,6)S(6,1) + S(8,5)S(6,2) + S(8,4)S(6,3) + S(8,3)S(6,4)\\] \\[= 1 \\cdot 6 + 16 \\cdot 15 + 45 \\cdot 16 + 50 \\cdot 6 = 1266\\]\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2 and 3 b.}$\n\n\\[\\sum_{i=3}^{5} S(8,8-i)S(3,i-3) = S(8,5)S(3,0) + S(8,4)S(3,1)+S(8,3)S(3,2)\\] \\[= 16 \\cdot 1 + 45 \\cdot 3 + 50 \\cdot 3 = 301\\]\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2 and 3 c.}$\n\n\\[\\sum_{i=2}^{5} S(6,i-1)S(5,6-i) = S(6,1)S(5,4) + S(6,2)S(5,3) + S(6,3)S(5,2) + S(6,4)S(5,1)\\] \\[= 6 \\cdot 1 + 15 \\cdot 7 + 16 \\cdot 10 + 6 \\cdot 5 = 301\\]\n\nPutting it all together, in this case we have\n\n\\[\\sum_{i = 0}^{8} S(8,8-i)S(6,i-1) = 2 \\cdot 1266 - 301 - 301 = 2 \\cdot 965 = 1930\\]\n\n$\\textbf{Case 4}$\n\nFinally, \\[\\sum_{i=0}^{8} S(7,8-i)S(5,i-2) = \\sum_{i=3}^{6} S(7,8-i)S(5,i-2)\\] \\[= S(7,5)S(5,1)+S(7,4)S(5,2)+S(7,3)S(5,3)+S(7,2)S(5,4)\\]\n\nNow $S(7,5) = S(5,5)+2S(5,4)-S(2,2)+S(4,3) = 0+2-1+2 = 3$ and $S(7,4) = S(5,4)+2S(5,3)-S(2,1)+S(4,2) = 1+2 \\cdot 7 - 2 + 6 = 19$ .\n\nTherefore, \\[\\sum_{i=0}^{8} S(7,8-i)S(5,i-2) = 3 \\cdot 5 + 19 \\cdot 10 + 30 \\cdot 7 + 21 \\cdot 1 = 436\\]\n\nFinally,\n\n\\[S(16,8) = \\sum_{i = 0}^{8} S(8, 8-i)S(6, i) + S(8,8-i) \\cdot (S(6, i-1)-S(3, i-3))\\] \\[+ S(6, i-1) \\cdot (S(8, 8-i)-S(5, 6-i)) + S(7,8-i)S(5,i-2)\\]\n\n\\[= \\sum_{i = 2}^{4} S(8,8-i)S(6,i) + (2 \\sum_{i=2}^{5} S(8,8-i)S(6,i-1) - \\sum_{i=3}^{5} S(8,8-i)S(3,i-3) - \\sum_{i=2}^{5} S(6,i-1)S(5,6-i)) + \\sum_{i=3}^{6} S(7,8-i)S(5,i-2)\\]\n\n\\[= 541 + 1930 + 436 = 2907\\]\n\nThus the answer is \\[\\boxed{907}\\]\n\n~KingRavi"

        "content": "By drawing out the triangle, I set $A$ to be $(0, 0)$ in the coordinate plane. I set $C$ to be $(x, 0)$ and B to be $(0, y)$ . I set $K$ to be $(a, b)$ and $L$ to be $(c, d)$ . Then, since all of these distances are $14$ , I used coordinate geometry to set up the following equations: $a^{2} + b^{2} = 196$ ; $a^{2} + (b - y)^{2} = 196$ ; $(a - c)^{2} + (b - d)^{2} = 196$ ; $c^{2} + d^{2} = 196$ ; $(c - x)^{2} + d^{2} = 196$ . Notice by merging the first two equations, the only possible way for it to work is if $b - y = -b$ which means $y = 2b$ . Next, since the triangle is right, and we know one leg is $2b$ as $y = 2b$ , the other leg, $x$ , is $\\sqrt{38^{2} - (2b)^{2}}$ .\nWe now have:\n\n$a^{2} + b^{2} = 196  \\hspace{1 cm} \\textbf{(1)}$\n\n$(a - c)^{2} + (b - d)^{2} = 196 \\hspace{1 cm} \\textbf{(2)}$\n\n$c^{2} + d^{2} = 196  \\hspace{1 cm} \\textbf{(3)}$\n\n$(c - \\sqrt{38^{2} - (2b)^{2}})^{2} + d^{2} = 196  \\hspace{1 cm} \\textbf{(4)}$\n\nExpanding equation (4) and simplifying, we end with $38^{2} - 4b^{2} = 2c \\cdot \\sqrt{38^{2} - 4b^{2}}$ . Next, squaring both sides and canceling terms, we have $4 \\cdot 19^{2} - 4b^{2} = 4c^{2}$ which tells us that $c^{2} = 19^{2} - b^{2}$ . Now, plugging this value in into equation (3) tells us that $d^{2} = 196 - 19^{2} + b^{2}$ . We expand equation (2) to get $a^{2} - 2ac + c^{2} + b^{2} - 2bd + d^{2} = 196$ . Using equation (1), we can cancel terms and shift things over to get $196 = 2ac + 2bd$ which means $98 = ac + bd$ . From equation (1), we have $a^{2} = 196 - b^{2}$ . Now, plugging in all of our variables in terms of $b$ to this new equation, we have $98 = \\sqrt{(361 - b^{2})(196 - b^{2}} + b\\sqrt{b^{2} - 165}$ . We now move things over to get $98 - b\\sqrt{b^{2} - 165} = \\sqrt{(361 - b^{2})(196 - b^{2}}$ . Squaring both sides and canceling, we have $98^{2} - 196b\\sqrt{b^{2} - 165} = (361)(196) - 392b^{2}$ . We can now divide both sides by $196$ to get $49 - b\\sqrt{b^{2} - 165} = 361 - 2b^{2}$ . Rearranging and simplifying, we now have $2b^{2} - 312 = b\\sqrt{b^{2} - 165}$ . Squaring both sides and combining like terms, we have $3b^{4} - 1083b^{2} + 312^{2} = 0$ . This part will be a bit of a bash. Quadratic Formula tells us that $b^{2} = \\frac{1083 \\pm \\sqrt{1083^{2} - 12 \\cdot 312^{2}}}{6}$ . The discriminant nicely simplifies to $\\sqrt{4761} = 69$ (this will be an extremely long bash but it's worth it). In fact, after computing, we end up with $b^{2} = 192, 169$ . This leads us to solutions of $b = 8\\sqrt{3}, 13$ . If we choose $b = 8\\sqrt{3}$ , then $c^{2} = 361 - b^{2} = 361 - 192 = 169$ which tells us that $c = 13$ .(In fact if you choose $b = 13$ , then $c = 8\\sqrt{3}$ so it's symmetrical and doesn't matter which one you choose). Next, $a^{2} = 196 - b^{2} = 196 - 192 = 4$ which tells us that $a = 2$ . Finally, $d^{2} = 196 - c^{2} = 196 - 169 = 27$ which tells us that $d = 3\\sqrt{3}$ . Therefore, after all the bashing, our solution quadruple is $a = 2, b = 8\\sqrt{3}, c = 13, d = 3\\sqrt{3}$ . Now plugging in all the points and using the Pythagorean Theorem, we get the coordinates of the quadrilateral which are $(0, 16\\sqrt{3}), (2, 8\\sqrt{3}), (13, 3\\sqrt{3})$ , and $(26, 0)$ . By Shoelace, our area is $104\\sqrt{3}$ . Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{104}$ .\n\n~ilikemath247365"

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AC$ , and let $N$ be the midpoint of $AB$ .\n\nWe place the diagram onto the Cartesian coordinate grid. Let $A = (0, 0)$ , $M = (a, 0)$ , $C = (2a, 0)$ , $N = (0, b)$ , and $B = (0, 2b)$ . We are given $AL = CL$ , so $\\triangle ACL$ is isosceles. Therefore, $LM$ is the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ , so we can let $L = (a, y)$ . Similarly, we’re given $AK = BK$ , so $\\triangle ABK$ is also isosceles, and $NK$ is the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ . Therefore, we can let $K = (x, b)$ .\n\nWe have $AB = 2b$ and $AC = 2a$ . We’re given that $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$ and $BC = 38$ , so by the Pythagorean theorem, \\[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2 = 38^2 \\implies 4a^2 + 4b^2 = 1444 \\implies a^2 + b^2 = 361.\\]\n\nWe now place the diagram onto the complex plane. We use the x-axis of the coordinate plane as the complex plane’s real axis, and we use the y-axis of the coordinate plane as the complex plane’s imaginary axis. So, on the complex plane, $A = 0$ , $L = a + yi$ , and $K = x + bi$ . Also, since we are given $AK = KL = AL$ , $\\triangle AKL$ is equilateral. In addition, since $AL = AK$ , $\\angle KAL = 60^\\circ$ , and because we constructed our diagram with $K$ counterclockwise of $L$ (if it were the other way around, we could go through the same steps as this solution, but with variables switched around), $K$ is a $60^\\circ$ counterclockwise rotation of $L$ about $A$ , and $L$ is a $60^\\circ$ clockwise or $300^\\circ$ counterclockwise rotation of $K$ about $A$ .\n\nRotation on the complex plane is equivalent to multiplying by a root of unity. Here, $K$ and $L$ are rotated a multiple of $60^\\circ$ to each other about $A$ . $60^\\circ$ is one-sixth of a full circle, so to go from $L$ to $K$ or $K$ to $L$ , we multiply by a 6th root of unity. Specifically, to go from $L$ to $K$ , we multiply by $\\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ , and to go from $K$ to $L$ , we multiply by $\\dfrac{1}{2} - \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ .\n\nWe multiply the coordinate of $L$ by $\\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ on the complex plane to obtain equations for the coordinates of $K$ : \\[(a + yi)\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\right) = \\left(\\dfrac{a}{2} - \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y\\right) + \\left(\\dfrac{y}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a\\right)i = x + bi.\\] Equating real and imaginary parts, we obtain \\[x = \\dfrac{a}{2} - \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}y \\text{ and } b = \\dfrac{y}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a.\\]\n\nSimilarly, we multiply the coordinate of $K$ by $\\dfrac{1}{2} - \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ to obtain equations for the coordinates of $L$ : \\[(x + bi)\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2} - \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\right) = \\left(\\dfrac{x}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}b\\right) + \\left(\\dfrac{b}{2} - \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x\\right) = a + yi.\\] Equating real and imaginary parts, we obtain \\[a = \\dfrac{x}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}b \\text{ and } y = \\dfrac{b}{2} - \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x.\\]\n\nWe now look back at the problem to see what it asks for: $[BKLC]$ . Looking at the diagram, we see we can express the area of the quadrilateral as the area of the big right triangle $ABC$ minus the two isosceles triangles $ABK$ and $ALC$ minus the equilateral triangle $AKL$ : \\[[BKLC] = [ABC] - [ABK] - [ACL] - [AKL].\\]\n\nWe are given that $AK = KL = AL = 14$ , so the area of equilateral triangle $AKL$ is $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot 14^2 = 49\\sqrt{3}$ . Also, we can use $AC = 2a$ as the base of $\\triangle ABC$ and $AB = 2b$ as the height, so $[ABC] = \\dfrac{(2a)(2b)}{2} = 2ab$ . Similarly, we use $AC = 2a$ as the base of $\\triangle ACL$ and $ML = y$ ( $M = (a, 0)$ and $L = (a, y)$ , so the distance between the two is equal to $y$ ) as the height, so $[ACL] = \\dfrac{(2a)(y)}{2} = ay$ . Finally, we use $AB = 2b$ and $KN = x$ ( $N = (0, b)$ and $K = (x, b)$ , so the distance between the two is equal to $x$ ) as the base and height of $\\triangle ABK$ respectively, so $[ABK] = \\dfrac{(2b)(x)}{2} = bx$ . Therefore, \\[[BKLC] = [ABC] - [ABK] - [ACL] - [AKL] = 2ab - bx - ay - 49\\sqrt{3}.\\]\n\nWe have already shown that $b = \\dfrac{y}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$ . Substituting this into $a^2 + b^2 = 361$ , we have \\[a^2 + \\left(\\dfrac{y}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a\\right)^2 = 361.\\] Expanding this out, we have \\[a^2 + \\dfrac{y^2}{4} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}ay + \\dfrac{3}{4}a^2 = 361.\\] Multiplying both sides by $4$ and rearranging the left side, we have \\[7a^2 + y^2 + 2ay\\sqrt{3} = 1444.\\] We previously showed that $AC \\perp ML$ , so $AM \\perp ML$ (since $M$ is on $AC$ ). Therefore, $\\triangle AML$ has a right angle at $M$ . By the Pythagorean theorem, $AM^2 + ML^2 = a^2 + y^2 = AL^2 = 196$ . Subtracting $a^2 + y^2$ from the left side and $196$ from the right side, we obtain \\[6a^2 + 2ay\\sqrt{3} = 1248.\\] Dividing both sides of the equation by $2\\sqrt{3}$ and factoring $a$ out of the left side, we have \\[a(a\\sqrt{3} + y) = 208\\sqrt{3}.\\] However, we have $b = \\dfrac{y}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a$ , so the expression inside the parentheses is simply $2b$ ! Therefore, \\[2ab = 208\\sqrt{3}.\\]\n\nThe algebra’s not over yet. We also showed that $a = \\dfrac{x}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}b$ , so substituting that into $a^2 + b^2 + 361$ , we obtain \\[b^2 + \\left(\\dfrac{x}{2} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}b\\right)^2 = 361.\\] Expanding this out, we have \\[b^2 + \\dfrac{x^2}{4} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}bx + \\dfrac{3}{4}b^2 = 361.\\] Multiplying both sides by $4$ and rearranging the left side, we now have \\[7b^2 + x^2 + 2xb\\sqrt{3} = 1444.\\] Does this equation look familiar? We previously showed that $NK \\perp AB$ . Therefore, $NK \\perp AN$ (since $N$ is on $AB$ ). So, $\\triangle ANK$ has a right angle at $N$ . By the Pythagorean theorem, $AN^2 + KN^2 = b^2 + x^2 = AK^2 = 196$ . Subtracting $b^2 + x^2$ from the left side and $196$ from the right side, we have \\[6b^2 + 2xb\\sqrt{3} = 1248.\\] We previously also had the equation $6a^2 + 2ay\\sqrt{3} = 1248$ , and adding this equation to the above equation and factoring out $2\\sqrt{3}$ , we have \\[6a^2 + 6b^2 + 2\\sqrt{3}(bx + ay) = 2496.\\] We previously showed $a^2 + b^2 = 361$ , so $6a^2 + 6b^2 = 6 \\cdot 361 = 2166$ . Subtracting $6a^2 + 6b^2$ from the left side and $2166$ from the right side, we obtain $2\\sqrt{3}(bx + ay) = 330$ . Finally, dividing both sides by $2\\sqrt{3}$ , we have \\[bx + ay = 55\\sqrt{3}.\\]\n\nWe previously arrived at this expression for $[BKLC]$ : \\[[BKLC] = 2ab - bx - ay - 49\\sqrt{3}.\\] We now know $2ab = 208\\sqrt{3}$ and $bx + ay = 55\\sqrt{3}$ , so we can simply substitute them in. Therefore, \\[[BKLC] = 2ab - bx - ay - 49\\sqrt{3} = 208\\sqrt{3} - 55\\sqrt{3} - 49\\sqrt{3} = 104\\sqrt{3}.\\] Finally, we are given $[BKLC] = n\\sqrt{3}$ for some integer $n$ . We know $[BKLC] = 104\\sqrt{3}$ , so $n = \\boxed{104}$ .\n\nNotice that $[BKLC] = 104\\sqrt{3} = \\dfrac{208\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\dfrac{[ABC]}{2}$ . Is this a coincidence?\n\n~V0305"

        "content": "What this problem is asking is to choose $k$ for which there exists a real $c$ with the property that \\[\\frac{(x-18)(x-72)(x-98)(x-k)}{x}=c\\] at exactly two positive reals $x$ . Specifically, $c$ is the minimum value of the expression for positive reals $x$ . This rewrites into $(x-18)(x-72)(x-98)(x-k)-cx=0$ having two roots. Because it is a quartic, then it is either the square of a quadratic or the product of a cubic and a linear. However, for the latter case, note that this essentially contradicts our minimality assumption. Therefore, it needs to be the square of a quadratic. We can write that squared quadratic as $x^2-mx+n$ . We would then have the equation \\[(x-18)(x-72)(x-98)(x-k)-cx=\\left (x^2-mx+n\\right )^2.\\]\n\nFirstly, compare the coefficients of $x^3$ . In the left equation, we can see by vietas that the term is $-(k+188)x^3$ , while in the right equation this is $-2mx^3$ . We then obtain the relationship $2mx^3=(k+188)x^3\\implies k=2m-188$ . So it is equivalent to finding the values of $m$ that work. Next, we can start plugging in convenient values for $x$ . For $x=18$ , we find that $-18c=(324-18m+n)^2$ . If we plug in $x=72$ , we also get $-72c=(5184-72m+n)^2$ . Similarly, $x=98$ gets us $-98c=(9604-98m+n)^2$ . Notice how we have three variables in a three-way systems of equations, so it can be solved. Dividing the second equation by the first equation, we get a new equation \\[\\frac{-72c}{-18c}=\\frac{(5184-72m+n)^2}{(324-18m+n)^2},\\] which simplifies to \\[4=\\left (\\frac{5184-72m+n}{324-18m+n}\\right )^2.\\] Taking the square root of both sides and doing a little rearranging, it simplifies into $5184-72m+n=\\pm 2(324-18m+n)$ . Proceeding similarly, we can divide the third equation by the first equation to get \\[\\frac{-98c}{-18c}=\\frac{(9604-98m+n)^2}{(324-18m+n)^2}\\implies \\frac{49}{9}=\\left (\\frac{9604-98m+n}{324-18m+n}\\right )^2\\implies 3(9604-98m+n)=\\pm 7(324-18m+n).\\]\n\nAt this point, we have now simplified it slightly down into two variables and two equations. We need both equations to be true, although the plus and the minus cases for each equation aren't necessarily both true at the same time. For convenience, let us call the four equations \\[5184-72m+n=2(324-18m+n),\\] \\[5184-72m+n=-2(324-18m+n),\\] \\[3(9604-98m+n)=7(324-18m+n), \\text{ and}\\] \\[3(9604-98m+n)=-7(324-18m+n)\\] as equations 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.\n\nTo make things simpler, we can simplify each equation down.\n\nIn equation 1, we have $5184-72m+n=648-36m+2n$ , so $36m+n=4536$ .\n\nIn equation 2, we have $5184-72m+n=-648+36m-2n$ , so $108m-3n=5832\\implies 36m-n=1944$ .\n\nIn equation 3, $28812-294m+3n=2268-126m+7n$ , so $168m+4n=26544\\implies 42m+n=6636$ .\n\nThen in equation 4, $28812-294m+3n=-2268+126m-7n$ , so $420m-10n=31080\\implies 42m-n=3108$ .\n\nNow, recall our earlier condition how both of those equations with the $\\pm$ must be true. Then we have four cases of which are true: Equations 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 3, and 2 and 4.\n\nCase 1: Equations 1 and 3 are true\n\nWe then have $36m+n=4536$ and $42m+n=6636$ . Subtracting the equations gives $6m=2100\\implies m=350$ . However, it is obvious that $n$ is negative. But then this would force that one of the roots in the quadratic $x^2-mx+n$ are negative, which contradicts our initial assumption that it occurs in the positive reals $x$ . This case doesn't provide any solutions.\n\nCase 2: Equations 1 and 4 are true\n\nIt requires $36m+n=4536$ and $42m-n=3108$ . Adding the two equations gives $78m=7644\\implies m=98$ . Then $n$ is positive, so this case does indeed work. Applying the relationship $k=2m-188$ from earlier gives $k=8$ as a possibility.\n\nCase 3: Equations 2 and 3 are true\n\nThen $36m-n=1944$ and $42m+n=6636$ . Adding the two equations, $78m=8580\\implies m=110$ . $n$ is indeed positive, so this case provides $k=2\\cdot 110-188=32$ .\n\nCase 4: Equations 2 and 4 are true\n\nThe two equations are $36m-n=1944$ and $42m-n=3108$ . Subtracting the first from the second, we see that $6m=1164\\implies m=194$ . We find that $n$ is also positive here, so it works. Then it can be easily found that $k=2\\cdot 194-188=200$ .\n\nTherefore, our possible values of $k$ are $k=8,32,200$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{240}$ .\n\n~ethanzhang1001"
