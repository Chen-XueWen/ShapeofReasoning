This means that placing down one man will effectively take away $2$ spots.\n\nThere are $14$ possible slots the first man can be placed. Once that man was placed, the next man only have $12$ possible slots because the slot that the first man is in is taken and the diametrically opposite spot to the first man can't have any men.

However, since the men are all indistinct from each other, you also have to divide that value by $5! = 120$ , since there are $120$ ways to arrange the $5$ men in each possible positioning of the men on the circle.

Rearranging, we have \\[(a-2)^2 = 4(4 + b)\\Longrightarrow a = 2\\pm2\\sqrt{4+b}.\\] Using the fact that $4+b$ must be a perfect square, we can easily see that the values for $b$ can be $-4, -3, 0, 5,$ and $12.$ Also since it's a \" $\\pm$ \" there will usually be $2$ solutions for $a$ for each value of $b.$ The two exceptions for this would be if $b = -4$ and $b = 12.$ For $b=-4$ because it would be a $\\pm0,$ which only gives one solution, instead of two. For $b=12$ , because then $a = -6$ , the solution for $m$ would equal $2,$ , and we don't want this. (We can know this by replacing the solutions into the quadratic formula).\n\nSo we have $5$ solutions for $b,$ each of which gives $2$ values for $a,$ except for $2$ and $b = -4,$ both of which only give one. So in total, there are $5*2 - 2 = 8$ ordered pairs of $(a,b)$ in this case.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2:}$\n\n$m$ has two solutions, but exactly one of them isn't equal to $2.$ This ensures that $1$ of the solutions is equal to $2.$\n\nLet $r$ be the other value of $m$ that isn't $2.$ By Vieta: \\begin{align*} r+2 &= -a-2\\\\ 2r &= 4+2a+b. \\end{align*} From the first equation, we subtract both sides by $2$ and double both sides to get $2r = -2a - 8$ which also equals to $4+2a+b$ from the second equation. Equating both, we have $4a + b + 12 = 0.$ We can easily count that there would be $11$ ordered pairs $(a,b)$ that satisfy that.\n\nHowever, there's an outlier case in which $r$ happens to also equal $2,$ and we don't want that. We can reverse engineer and find out that $r=2$ when $(a,b) = (-6, 12),$ which we overcounted. So we subtract by one and we conclude that there are $10$ ordered pairs of $(a,b)$ that satisfy this case.\n\nThis all shows that there is a total of $8+10 = 18$ amount of ordered pairs $(a,b).$ Multiplying this by $41$ (the amount of values for $c$ ) we get $18\\cdot41=\\boxed{738}$ as our final answer.\n\n~s214425"

Let the sum of these elements be $s$ . Note that for each “loop” of the numerator (mod $5$ ), each element of the set will be subtracted exactly once, meaning $s$ is subtracted once for each loop.

However, we will find that this is a negligible error when it comes to the inequality $-1000<U<1000$ , so we can proceed with this approximation to solve for $a$ .\n\nFactoring our approximation gives $U \\approx \\frac {\\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1 - 3a)}{6}-404s}{5}$\n\nWe set $a= \\frac{(2n+1)}{3} = 1349$ to make $\\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1 - 3a)}{6}=0$ , accordingly minimizing $|U|$ , yielding $U \\approx  \\frac{-404s}{5}$\n\nIf $a$ increases or decreases by $1$ , then $U$ changes by $\\frac {(n)(n+1)}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac {2023 \\cdot 2024}{10}$ which clearly breaks the inequality on $U$ .

So, we must compute how many ways we can pick these numbers so that the set has no consecutive numbers other than (1,2). Our first option is to pick no more numbers, giving us $8 \\choose {0}$ . We can also pick one number, giving us $7 \\choose {1}$ because 3 cannot be picked. Another choice is to pick two numbers and in order to make sure they are not consecutive we must fix one number in between them, giving us $6 \\choose {2}$ . This pattern continues for each amount of numbers, yielding $5 \\choose {3}$ for 3 numbers and $4 \\choose {4}$ for four numbers.

Then we obtain that $x^2+xy+y^2 = 42^2$ , $x^2+xz+z^2 = 13^2$ , $y^2+yz+z^2 = 35^2$ . Note that since the area of the triangle by sine area formula is $(xy + xz + yz)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)$ , but by Heron's formula, the area of the triangle is $\\sqrt{(45)(3)(32)(10)} = (5)(3)(8)\\sqrt{3} = 120\\sqrt{3}$ . $xy+xz+yz = 480$ , and so we obtain $x+y+z = 11\\sqrt{19}$ by adding all the equations together.

        "content": "Recall that if $\\theta$ is the angle between two lines with slopes $m_1, m_2$ , we can write:\n\n$\\tan(\\theta) = \\mid \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1 \\cdot m_2} \\mid$\n\nWe will use this fact to solve the problem. Let $B$ be at the origin, $C$ be at $(55, 0)$ and $A$ be at $(\\frac{55}{2}, \\frac{55\\sqrt{3}}{2})$ . Next, we can easily find the equation of line $AB$ as $y = x\\sqrt{3}$ and the equation of line $AC$ as $y = -x\\sqrt{3} + 55\\sqrt{3}$ . We also know that $D$ is at $(7, 0)$ given the problem's conditions. We can now find the coordinates of $E$ and $F$ . To find the coordinates of $F$ , recall that $F$ lies on line segment $AB$ which has equation $y = x\\sqrt{3}$ . Hence, $F$ will be a point of the form $(x, x\\sqrt{3})$ . We also know the distance between $F$ and $B$ (the origin), is just $55 - 40 = 15$ . So the distance between the point $(x, x\\sqrt{3})$ and $(0, 0)$ is just $15$ . We can use the distance formula to get a solution of $x = \\frac{15}{2}$ (there will be two solutions but one of them is unfeasible). So the coordinates of $F$ is just $(\\frac{15}{2}, \\frac{15\\sqrt{3}}{2})$ . Similarly, we can find the coordinates of $E$ in a similar way to get $(40, 15\\sqrt{3})$ . Note that $\\angle BFP = \\angle PEA = \\angle PDC = \\theta$ . Let's focus on $\\angle BFP$ . This angle is between lines $BF$ and $FP$ so we just have to compute the slopes of these lines. Let $P$ be at point $(a, b)$ . Then, the slope of $BF$ is just $\\sqrt{3}$ and the slope of $FP$ is just $\\frac{2b - 15\\sqrt{3}}{2a - 15}$ . Because the angle between these two lines is $\\theta$ , we can use our above lemma to get the equation:\n\n$\\tan(\\theta) = \\mid \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - \\frac{2b - 15\\sqrt{3}}{2a - 15}}{1 + \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\frac{2b - 15\\sqrt{3}}{2a - 15}} \\mid$\n\nWe can similarly use the other angles and lines to come up with two more of these type of equations:\n\n$\\tan(\\theta) = \\mid \\frac{-\\sqrt{3} - \\frac{15\\sqrt{3} - b}{40 - a}}{1 - \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\frac{15\\sqrt{3} - b}{40 - a}} \\mid$\n\n$\\tan(\\theta) = \\mid \\frac{b}{7 - a} \\mid$\n\nWe have $3$ equations with $3$ variables and since we are trying to find $\\tan(\\theta)^{2}$ , we can treat $\\tan(\\theta)$ as a variable. We solve to get $\\tan(\\theta) = 5\\sqrt{3}$ and therefore our answer is just $\\boxed{075}$ .\n\n$\\textbf{Note: How to solve the system of equations}$\n\nThe first step is to realize that we need to make the inputs nicer. So we clear the fractions and set them equal. Doing so, we have:\n\n$\\frac{a\\sqrt{3} - b}{a + b\\sqrt{3} - 30} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3} + b - 55\\sqrt{3}}{-a + b\\sqrt{3} - 5} = \\frac{b}{7 - a}$ .\n\nNow we can write:\n\n$\\frac{a\\sqrt{3} - b}{a + b\\sqrt{3} - 30} = \\frac{b}{7 - a}$\n\n$\\frac{a\\sqrt{3} + b - 55\\sqrt{3}}{-a + b\\sqrt{3} - 5} = \\frac{b}{7 - a}$\n\nHere, we're going to change $a$ to $x$ and $b$ to $y$ just to make the solving more traditional. We can cross multiply the first equation and simplify to get\n\n$7x\\sqrt{3} - x^{2} \\sqrt{3} = y^{2} \\sqrt{3} - 23y$\n\nNext, we cross multiply the second equation to get:\n\n$7x\\sqrt{3} - x^{2} \\sqrt{3} + 7y - xy - 385\\sqrt{3} + 55x\\sqrt{3} = -xy + y^{2} \\sqrt{3} - 5y$\n\nNotice we could make some substitutions from our first equation to the second equation:\n\n$y^{2} \\sqrt{3} - 23y + 7y - 385\\sqrt{3} + 55x\\sqrt{3} = y^{2} \\sqrt{3} - 5y$\n\nWe simplify this to get:\n\n$-16y - 385\\sqrt{3} + 55x\\sqrt{3} = -5y$\n\nThis means:\n\n$55x\\sqrt{3} - 385\\sqrt{3} = 11y$\n\nWhich yields:\n\n$y = 5\\sqrt{3}(x - 7)$\n\nNow, we plug this representation into the equation $7x\\sqrt{3} - x^{2} \\sqrt{3} = y^{2} \\sqrt{3} - 23y$ we got earlier to get:\n\n$7x\\sqrt{3} - x^{2} \\sqrt{3} = 75\\sqrt{3} (x - 7)^{2} - 115x\\sqrt{3} + 805\\sqrt{3}$\n\nWe can expand and simplify to get:\n\n$122x\\sqrt{3} - x^{2} \\sqrt{3} = 75x^{2} \\sqrt{3} - 1050x\\sqrt{3} + 4480\\sqrt{3}$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$76x^{2} \\sqrt{3} - 1172x\\sqrt{3} + 4480\\sqrt{3} = 0$\n\nThis yields:\n\n$19x^{2} - 293x + 1120 = 0$\n\nNow this is trivial to solve:\n\n$x = \\frac{293 \\pm \\sqrt{293^{2} - 76\\cdot1120}}{38}$\n\nTo find $293^{2}$ really quickly under contest conditions, we can do:\n\n$293^{2} = (200 + 93)^{2} = 200^{2} + 400\\cdot93 + (90 + 3)^{2} = 40000 + 37200 + 8100 + 549 = 85849$\n\nNow back to simplifying $x$ :\n\nThe discriminant nicely simplifies to $85849 - 85120 = 729 = 27^{2}$\n\nSo we have $x = \\frac{293 + 27}{38} = \\frac{320}{38} = \\frac{160}{19}$ . (Note that if we take the negative version of the solution, we would have $x = \\frac{266}{38} = 7$ but this would yield $y = 5\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 7 - 35\\sqrt{3} = 0$ which is absurd)\n\nAnd now we're basically done. Recall that $y = 5x\\sqrt{3} - 35\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}\\cdot160}{19} - \\frac{35\\sqrt{3}\\cdot19}{19} = \\frac{135\\sqrt{3}}{19}$ . Now recall that we let $a = x$ and $b = y$ so we now have $a = \\frac{160}{19}$ and $b = \\frac{135\\sqrt{3}}{19}$ .\n\nNow, recall that $\\tan(\\theta) = \\mid \\frac{b}{7 - a} \\mid = \\mid \\frac{\\frac{135\\sqrt{3}}{19}}{7 - \\frac{160}{19}} \\mid = \\mid \\frac{\\frac{135\\sqrt{3}}{19}}{\\frac{133 - 160}{19}} \\mid = \\mid \\frac{135\\sqrt{3}}{-27} \\mid = \\mid -5\\sqrt{3} \\mid = 5\\sqrt{3}$ as desired.\n\n~ilikemath247365"

In other words, Felix the frog starts his journey at $(0,0)$ in the coordinate plane.  Every second, he jumps either to the right or up, until he reaches an $x$ - or $y$ -coordinate of $12$ .  At this point, if he tries to jump to a coordinate outside the square from $(0,0)$ to $(11,11)$ , he \"wraps around\" and ends up at an $x$ - or $y$ - coordinate of $0$ .  How many ways are there for Felix to jump on every grid point in this square, so that he ends at $(0,0)$ ?  This is consistent with the construction of the flat torus as $\\mathbb Z^2/12\\mathbb Z^2$ (2-dimensional modular arithmetic. $(\\mathbb{Z}_{12})^2$ )\n\nMoving on, define a $\\textit{path}$ from point $A$ to point $B$ to be a sequence of \"up\"s and \"right\"s that takes Felix from $A$ to $B$ .  The $\\textit{distance}$ from $A$ to $B$ is the length of the shortest path from $A$ to $B$ .

Your goal is to have a single path across all nodes on the grid leading back to $(0,\\ 0)$ . For convenience, any grid position are presumed to be in $\\mod N$ .\n\nNote that there are exactly two ways to reach node $(i,\\ j)$ , namely $(i - 1,\\ j)$ and $(i,\\ j - 1)$ .\n\nAs a result, if a path includes a step from $(i,\\ j)$ to $(i + 1,\\ j)$ , there cannot be a step from $(i,\\ j)$ to $(i,\\ j + 1)$ . However, a valid solution must reach $(i,\\ j + 1)$ , and the only valid step is from $(i - 1,\\ j + 1)$ .\n\nSo a solution that includes a step from $(i,\\ j)$ to $(i + 1,\\ j)$ dictates a step from $(i - 1,\\ j + 1)$ to $(i,\\ j + 1)$ and by extension steps from $(i - a,\\ j + a)$ to $(i - a + 1,\\ j + a)$ . We observe the equivalent result for steps in the orthogonal direction.\n\nThis means that in constructing a valid solution, taking one step in fact dictates N steps, thus it's sufficient to count valid solutions with $N = a + b$ moves of going right $a$ times and $b$ times up the grid. The number of distinct solutions can be computed by permuting 2 kinds of indistinguishable objects $\\binom{N}{a}$ .\n\nHere we observe, without proof, that if $\\gcd(a, b) \\neq 1$ , then we will return to the origin prematurely.

These follow from the definition of $S_0$ . Each column of $R$ is a permutation of $\\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots , 11 \\right\\}$ . The reasoning is as follows. Suppose there exist $i < i'$ , $j$ , such that $r_{i, j} = r_{i', j}$ .

This leads to the infeasibility of the movements. $x_{i+1, 1} = x_{i, 12}$ for any $i \\in \\left\\{ 1, 2, \\cdots , 11 \\right\\}$ . This follows from the conditions that the $12$ th column in $R$ excluding $r_{12, 12}$ and the first column in $R$ excluding $x_{1, 1}$ are both permutations of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, \\cdots , 11 \\right\\}$ .\n\nAll observations jointly imply that $x_{i, 12} = i \\cdot x_{1, 12}$ .\nThus, $\\left\\{ r_{1, 12}, r_{2, 12} , \\cdots , r_{11, 12} \\right\\}$ is a permutation of $\\left\\{ 1, 2, \\cdots , 11 \\right\\}$ .\nThus, $x_{1, 12}$ is relatively prime to 12.\n\nBecause $x_{1, 1} = 0$ and $x_{1, 12} - x_{1, 1} \\leq 11$ , we have $x_{1, 12} = 1$ , 5, 7, or 11.\n\nRecall that when we move from $x_{1, 1}$ to $x_{1, 12}$ , there are 11 steps of movements. Each movement has $x_{1, j+1} - x_{i, j} = 0$ or 1.\nThus, for each given $x_{1, 12}$ , the number of feasible movements from $x_{1, 1}$ to $x_{1, 12}$ is $\\binom{11}{x_{1, 12}}$ .\n\nTherefore, the total number of feasible movement sequences in this problem is \\begin{align*} | S_0 | + | S_{11} | & = 2 | S_0 | \\\\ & = 2 \\cdot \\sum_{x_{1, 12} = 1, 5, 7, 11} \\binom{11}{x_{1, 12}} \\\\ & = 2 \\left( 11 + 462 + 330 + 1 \\right) \\\\ & = 1608 . \\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(608)}}$ .\n\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)"

Every remaining subsets $S$ will have $a$ as an element so $S\\cap{A}\\geq1$ , since we just excluded all that do not. Since there are 15 subsets left, all are forced into the group of 16 subsets, so we just choose the number of $a$ to determine the set $A$ . $A\\in\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ so there are 5 ways.\n\nFor the rest of the cases, we assume there are no sets $A$ with cardinality 1.  Notice that the only way to \"violate\" the condition is to have subsets $X$ and $Y$ with cardinalities 2 and 3 in some order. Otherwise, by the Pigeonhole Principle, if two sets both have cardinalities more than 3, they are bound to have one element of intersection. Say a set $S$ has $|S|=2$ , then there is clearly only one set $s$ that will make $S\\cap{s}=0$ . By our previous claim, all other subsets that have cardinality $c\\geq{3}$ will work.\n\nNow if we generalize a bit: If a subset has $N$ 2-element subsets which belong to set $M$ , then there are exactly $N$ subsets with cardinality 3 that don't work. Therefore, the number of \"violating subsets\" are all subsets with cardinality $c\\leq{1}$ , all 2-element subsets that are not in $M$ , and all corresponding cardinality 3 subsets. Subtracting from the total 32 subsets, we get that $32-(1+5+(10-N)+N)=16$ subsets that do work. This includes all subsets in $M$ , so the remaining non-violating subsets are forced. This is equivalent now to choosing $N$ 2 element subsets.\n\nFollowing casework on the number of 2-element subsets:\n\nIf $N=1$ : There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways.\n\nIf $N=2$ : There are $5$ ways to choose the intersection between the 2 sets (remember they have to have at least one element of intersection) and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the distinct elements in the subsets, so there are $5*6=30$ ways.\n\nIf $N=3$ : It can be a cycle, where WLOG let the elements be $a,b,c$ so the sets are $\\{a,b\\}$ , $\\{b,c\\}$ , and $\\{c,a\\}$ . This is just $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ . Alternatively, it can also be the case where all sets share one element. There are 5 ways to choose this element and $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the remaining elements to assign to each set. There are $30$ ways.\n\nIf $N=4$ : By the Pigeonhole Principle, the only way all pairwise sets have at one common intersection is if all share one element in common. There are 5 ways to choose this element and the remaining numbers are forced. There are 5 ways.\n\n$N\\geq{5}$ does not provide any valid cases since to have all pairwise elements to intersect one element, they must be the same element by the Pigeonhole Principle, but there are not enough subsets.\n\nIf $N=0$ , then there is only one way since $\\binom{5}{3}+\\binom{5}{4}+\\binom{5}{5}=16$ .\n\nAdding all cases yields $5+10+30+30+5+1=\\boxed{81}$ ways!\n\n-Magnetoninja"

Equating the 2 expressions, you get that $\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{BPQ})}{BQ}=\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{QPC})}{QP}$ . Now drop the altitude from $A$ to $BC$ . As it is commonly known that the dropped altitude forms a $5-12-13$ and a $9-12-15$ triangle, you get the measures of $\\angle{ABC}$ and $\\angle{ACB}$ respectively, which are $\\arcsin(\\frac{12}{13})$ and $\\arcsin(\\frac{4}{5})$ . However, by the inscribed angle theorem, you get that $\\angle{BPQ}=\\arcsin(\\frac{4}{5})$ and that $\\angle{QPC}=\\arcsin(\\frac{12}{13})$ , respectively. Therefore, by Law of Sines (as previously stated) $\\frac{BQ}{CQ}=\\frac{13}{15}$ .\n\nNow commence coordbashing. Let $B$ be the origin, and $A$ be the point $(5,12)$ . As $AP$ passes through $A$ , which is $(5,12)$ , and $M$ , which is $(7,0)$ , it has the equation $-6x+42$ , so therefore a point on this line can be written as $(x,42-6x)$ . As we have the ratio of the lengths, which prompts us to write the lengths in terms of the distance formula, we can just plug and chug it in to get the ratio $\\frac{\\sqrt{37x^2-504x+1764}}{\\sqrt{37x^2-532x+1960}}=\\frac{13}{15}$ . This can be squared to get $\\frac{37x^2-504x+1764}{37x^2-532x+1960}=\\frac{169}{225}$ . This can be solved to get a solution of $x=\\frac{469}{74}$ , and an extraneous solution of $5$ which obviously doesn’t work.\n\nPlugging $x$ into the line equation gets you $y=\\frac{147}{37}$ .

Now notice $\\angle MBP = \\angle MAC$ because they both intercept the same circular arc $PC$ . Next, $\\angle BMP = \\angle AMC$ by vertical angles.

Hence, we again have Angle-Angle similarity and thus triangles $PMC$ is similar to triangle $ABM$ . Now, we bring out the similarity ratios to solve for $x$ and $y$ and finish the problem.

Interestingly enough, both numbers are centered around $98$ which means notice $105 = 98 + 7$ and $91 = 98 - 7$ .

Note that $\\angle BMP = \\angle QMC$ by vertical angles and note that $BM = CM = 7$ .

Note that if \\[23 b_{n+1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{n+1}}\\] Then \\[23 b_{n+1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{n}}\\] Also \\[23 b_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n}\\] Therefore \\[b_n \\equiv b_{n+1} \\equiv 23^{-1} \\pmod{2^n}\\] Then \\[b_{n+1} \\equiv b_n, b_n + 2^n \\pmod{2^{n+1}}\\] So \\[b_{n+1} = b_n, b_n + 2^n\\] Since $0 \\le b_n < 2^n$ and $0 \\le b_{n+1} < 2^{n+1}$ as $a_n$ is the least positive integer multiple of 23.\n\nNow suppose $b_{n+1} = b_n$ . Define $q_n$ to be the quotient of $23b_n$ divided by $2^n$ . Then \\[23b_n = 2^n q_n + 1 \\text{ and } 23b_{n+1} = 23b_n = 2^{n+1} q_{n+1} + 1 = 2^n q_n + 1 \\implies q_{n+1} = \\frac{q_n}{2}\\] Furthermore if quotient $q_n$ is even then \\[23b_n = 2^n q_n +1 = 2^{n+1} \\frac{q_n}{2} +1\\] Therefore $b_{n+1} = b_n$ if and only if $q_n$ is even. And, if this is true, then $q_{n+1} = \\frac{q_n}{2}$ . Next, if $q_n$ is odd, we must have $b_{n+1} = b_n + 2^n$ . Solving for $q_{n+1}$ , we have \\[23b_{n+1} = 2^{n+1} q_{n+1} + 1 \\implies 23b_n + 23 \\cdot 2^n = 2^{n+1} q_{n+1} + 1 \\implies 2^n q_n + 1 + 23 = 2^{n+1} q_{n+1} + 1 \\implies q_{n+1} = \\frac{q_n + 1}{2} + 11\\] Therefore, if $q_n$ is odd, $q_{n+1} = \\frac{q_n + 1}{2} + 11$ . In sum, our recursion is \\[q_n = \\begin{cases} \\frac{q_{n-1}}{2} & \\text{if } 2 \\text{ } \\vert \\text{ } q_{n-1} \\\\ \\frac{q_{n-1}+1}{2} + 11 &\\text{if } 2 \\not\\vert \\text{ } q_{n-1} \\end{cases}\\] Finally, let us list out $q_n$ to find a pattern. Because $a_1 = 23$ , $q_1 = 11$ . Through our recursion, we continue like so: \\[q_1 = 11, q_2 = 17, q_2 = 20, q_3 = 10, q_4 = 5, q_6 = 14, q_7 = 7, q_8 = 15, q_9 = 19, q_{10} = 21, q_{11} = 22, q_{12} = 11, \\dots\\] Therefore $q_n$ repeats with cycle length $11$ . Since $a_{n+1} = a_n$ if and only if $q_n$ is even, in each cycle, we have 4 satisfactory values of $n$ . There are $\\frac{1000 - 10}{11} = 90$ complete cycles. There are 3 extra values in the last incomplete cycle. Therefore we obtain $90 \\cdot 4 + 3 = \\fbox{363}$ .\n\n~ CrazyVideoGamez"

        "content": "We first check that $\\gcd(23, 2^n) = 1$ hence we are always seeking a unique modular inverse of $23$ , $b_n$ , such that $a_n \\equiv 23b_n \\equiv 1 \\mod{2^n}$ .\n\nNow that we know that $b_n$ is unique, we proceed to recast this problem in binary. This is convenient because $x \\mod{2^n}$ is simply the last $n$ -bits of $x$ in binary, and if $x \\equiv 1 \\mod{2^n}$ , it means that of the last $n$ bits of $x$ , only the rightmost bit (henceforth $0$ th bit) is $1$ .\n\nAlso, multiplication in binary can be thought of as adding shifted copies of the multiplicand. For example:\n\n\\begin{align} 10111_2 \\times 1011_2 &= 10111_2 \\times (1000_2 + 10_2 + 1_2) \\\\               &= 10111000_2 + 101110_2 + 10111_2 \\\\               &= 11111101_2 \\end{align}\n\nNow note $23 = 10111_2$ , and recall that our objective is to progressively zero out the $n$ leftmost bits of $a_n = 10111_2 \\times b_n$ except for the $0$ th bit.\n\nWrite $b_n = \\underline{c_{n-1}\\cdots c_2c_1c_0}_2$ , we note that $c_0$ uniquely defines the $0$ th bit of $a_n$ , and once we determine $c_0$ , $c_1$ uniquely determines the $1$ st bit of $a_n$ , so on and so forth.\n\nFor example, $c_0 = 1$ satisfies $a_1 \\equiv10111_2 \\times 1_2 \\equiv 1 \\mod{10_2}$ Next, we note that the second bit of $a_1$ is $1$ , so we must also have $c_1 = 1$ in order to zero it out, giving\n\n\\[a_2 \\equiv 10111_2 \\times 11_2 \\equiv 101110_2 + a_1 \\equiv 1000101_2 \\equiv 01_2 \\mod{100_2}\\]\n\n$a_{n+1} = a_{n}$ happens precisely when $c_n = 0$ . In fact we can see this in action by working out $a_3$ . Note that $a_2$ has 1 on the $2$ nd bit, so we must choose $c_2 = 1$ . This gives\n\n\\[a_3 \\equiv 10111_2 \\times 111_2 \\equiv 1011100_2 + a_2 \\equiv 10100001_2 \\equiv 001_2 \\mod{1000_2}\\]\n\nNote that since the $3$ rd and $4$ th bit are $0$ , $c_3 = c_4 = 0$ , and this gives $a_3 = a_4 = a_5$ .\n\nIt may seem that this process will take forever, but note that $23 = 10111_2$ has $4$ bits behind the leading digit, and in the worst case, the leading digits of $a_n$ will have a cycle length of at most $16$ . In fact, we find that the cycle length is $11$ , and in the process found that $a_3 = a_4 = a_5$ , $a_6 = a_7$ , and $a_{11} = a_{12}$ .\n\nSince we have $90$ complete cycles of length $11$ , and the last partial cycle yields $a_{993} = a_{994} = a_{995}$ and $a_{996} = a_{997}$ , we have a total of $90 \\times 4 + 3 = \\boxed{363}$ values of $n \\le 1000$ such that $a_n = a_{n+1}$\n\n~ cocoa @ https://www.corgillogical.com"
