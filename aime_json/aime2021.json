We first observe $a$ must be at most 10; if $a \\ge 11$ , then $2^a - 2^b \\ge 2^{10} > 1000$ . As $2^{10} = 1024 \\approx 1000$ , we can first choose two different numbers $a > b$ from the set $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$ in $\\binom{11}{2}=55$ ways. This includes $(a,b) = (10,0)$ , $(10,1)$ , $(10,2)$ , $(10,3)$ , $(10,4)$ which are invalid as $2^a - 2^b > 1000$ in this case. For all other choices $a$ and $b$ , the value of $2^a - 2^b$ is less than 1000.\n\nWe claim that for all other choices of $a$ and $b$ , the values of $2^a - 2^b$ are pairwise distinct. More specifically, if $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ where $10 \\ge a_1 > b_1 \\ge 0$ and $10 \\ge a_2 > b_2 \\ge 0$ , we must show that $2^{a_1}-2^{b_1} \\neq 2^{a_2} - 2^{b_2}$ . Suppose otherwise for sake of contradiction; rearranging yields $2^{a_1}+2^{b_2} = 2^{a_2}+2^{b_1}$ . We use the fact that every positive integer has a unique binary representation:\n\nIf $a_1 \\neq b_2$ then $\\{a_1,b_2\\} = \\{a_2,b_1\\}$ ; from here we can deduce either $a_1=a_2$ and $b_1=b_2$ (contradicting the assumption that $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ , or $a_1=b_1$ and $a_2=b_2$ (contradicting the assumption $a_1>b_1$ and $a_2>b_2$ ).\n\nIf $a_1 = b_2$ then $2^{a_1}+2^{b_2} = 2 \\times 2^{a_1}$ , and it follows that $a_1=a_2=b_1=b_2$ , also contradicting the assumption $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ . Hence we obtain contradiction.*\n\nThen there are $\\binom{11}{2}-5$ choices for $(a,b)$ for which $2^a - 2^b$ is a positive integer less than 1000; by the above claim, each choice of $(a,b)$ results in a different positive integer $n$ . Then there are $55-5 = \\boxed{050}$ integers which can be expressed as a difference of two powers of 2.\n\nNote: The uniqueness of binary representation could be rather easily proven, but if you cannot convince yourself on the spot that this is the case, consider the following alternative proof. Let $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ where $10 \\ge a_1 > b_1 \\ge 0$ and $10 \\ge a_2 > b_2 \\ge 0$ and $2^{a_1}-2^{b_1} = 2^{a_2} - 2^{b_2}$ , for the sake of contradiction. Therefore $\\deg_{2}(2^{a_1}-2^{b_1})=\\deg_{2}(2^{a_2}-2^{b_2})$ , or $b_1=b_2$ . Plugging in, we see that $2^{a_1}=2^{a_2}$ , or $a_1=a_2$ , contradiction.\n\nNote by Ross Gao"

However, here's why it works out: Let the length of diagonal BD be a. Then, by the same logic as given in the solution by fidgetboss_4000, $x=\\frac{33+a^{2}}{2a}$ , $y=\\frac{11+a^{2}}{2a}$ , so $x-y=\\frac{11}{a}$ . Then, why does dividing by a to get a ratio work? It's because the orientation of quadrilaterals is different! In other words, instead of diagonal BD corresponding to diagonal $B_1$ $D_1$ , it corresponds to diagonal $A_1$ $C_1$ . Thus, to get the right ratio, we can find the ratio of the multiplied diagonals, then take the square root (this square root part is crucial. It happens because we essentially are taking something two-dimensional on the numerator and denominator, so to make it a one-dimensional similarity ratio, we must take the square root to half the dimension on each part). This yields $\\sqrt{\\frac{121}{a^{2}\\cdot b^{2}}}$ = $\\frac{11}{a\\cdot b}$ . However, by Ptolemy, $a\\cdot b$ =59. Thus, the ratio is indeed $\\frac{11}{59}$ . ~MATH-TITAN"

By a quick sketch, we have two subconditions: The point $(-k,20)$ is on or below the parabola $y=x^2-k.$ We need $20\\leq(-k)^2-k,$ from which $k\\geq5.$ Moreover, the point $(-k,20)$ is on the parabola $y=x^2-k$ when $k=5.$ We will prove that the two parabolas intersect at four distinct points at this value of $k:$ Substituting $y=x^2-5$ into $x=2(y-20)^2-5,$ we get $x=2\\left(\\left(x^2-5\\right)-20\\right)^2-5.$ Expanding and rearranging give \\[2x^4-100x^2-x+1245=0. \\hspace{20mm}(\\bigstar)\\] By either the graphs of the parabolas or the Rational Root Theorem, we conclude that $x=-5$ is a root of $(\\bigstar).$ So, we factor its left side: \\[(x+5)\\left(2x^3-10x^2-50x+249\\right)=0.\\] By either the graphs of the parabolas or Descartes' Rule of Signs, we conclude that $2x^3-10x^2-50x+249=0$ has two positive roots and one negative root such that $x\\neq-5.$ So, $(\\bigstar)$ has four distinct real roots, or the two parabolas intersect at four distinct points. For Subcondition A, we deduce that $k\\geq5.$ Remark for Subcondition A Recall that if $1\\leq k\\leq 4,$ then the point $(-k,20)$ is above the parabola $y=x^2-k.$ It follows that for $-k\\leq x\\leq0:$ The maximum value of $y$ for the parabola $y=x^2-k$ occurs at $x=-k,$ from which $y=k^2-k\\leq12.$ The minimum value of $y$ for the parabola $x=2(y-20)^2-k$ occurs at $x=0,$ from which $y=20-\\sqrt{\\frac k2}>18.$ Clearly, the parabola $x=2(y-20)^2-k$ and the left half of the parabola $y=x^2-k$ do not intersect. Therefore, the two parabolas do not intersect at four distinct points. The point $(0,-k)$ is on or below the parabola $x=2(y-20)^2-k.$ The lower half of the parabola $x=2(y-20)^2-k$ is $y=20-\\sqrt{\\frac{x+k}{2}}.$ We need $-k\\leq20-\\sqrt{\\frac k2},$ which holds for all values of $k.$ For Subcondition B, we deduce that $k$ can be any positive integer. For Condition 1, we obtain $\\boldsymbol{k\\geq5}$ by taking the intersection of Subconditions A and B. The four points of intersection lie on a circle with radius at most $21.$ For equations of circles, the coefficients of $x^2$ and $y^2$ must be the same. So, we add the equation $y=x^2-k$ to half the equation $x=2(y-20)^2-k:$ \\[y+\\frac12x=x^2+(y-20)^2-\\frac32k.\\] We expand, rearrange, and complete the squares: \\begin{align*} y+\\frac12x&=x^2+y^2-40y+400-\\frac32k \\\\ \\frac32k-400&=\\left(x^2-\\frac12x\\right)+\\left(y^2-41y\\right) \\\\ \\frac32k-400+\\frac{1}{16}+\\frac{1681}{4}&=\\left(x-\\frac14\\right)^2+\\left(y-\\frac{41}{2}\\right)^2. \\end{align*} We need $\\frac32k-400+\\frac{1}{16}+\\frac{1681}{4}\\leq21^2,$ from which $k\\leq\\left\\lfloor\\frac{6731}{24}\\right\\rfloor=280.$ For Condition 2, we obtain $\\boldsymbol{k\\leq280.}$\n\nTaking the intersection of Conditions 1 and 2 produces $5\\leq k\\leq280.$ Therefore, the answer is $5+280=\\boxed{285}.$\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM"

Completing the square gives us $\\left(y- \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(x - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{325+24k}{16}$ ; this explains why the two parabolas intersect at four points that lie on a circle*. For the upper bound, observe that $LHS \\leq 21^2=441 \\rightarrow 24k \\leq 6731$ , so $k \\leq 280$ .\n\nFor the lower bound, we need to ensure there are $4$ intersections to begin with. (Here I'm using the un-translated coordinates.) Draw up a graph, and realize that two intersections are guaranteed, on the so called \"right branch\" of $y=x^2-k$ . As we increase the value of $k$ , two more intersections appear on the \"left branch\":\n\n$k=4$ does not work because the \"leftmost\" point of $x=2(y-20)^2-4$ is $(-4,20)$ which lies to the right of $\\left(-\\sqrt{24}, 20\\right)$ , which is on the graph $y=x^2-4$ . While technically speaking this doesn't prove that there are no intersections (why?), drawing the graph should convince you that this is the case. Clearly, $k<4$ does not work.\n\n$k=5$ does work because the two graphs intersect at $(-5,20)$ , and by drawing the graph, you realize this is not a tangent point and there is in fact another intersection nearby, due to slope. Therefore, the answer is $5+280=\\boxed{285}$ .\n\nIn general (assuming four intersections exist), when two conics intersect, if one conic can be written as $ax^2+by^2=f(x,y)$ and the other as $cx^2+dy^2=g(x,y)$ for polynomials $f$ and $g$ of degree at most $1$ , whenever $(a,b),(c,d)$ are linearly independent (L.I.), we can combine the two equations and then complete the square to achieve $(x-p)^2+(y-q)^2=r^2$ . We can also combine these two equations to form a parabola, or a hyperbola, or an ellipse. When $(a,b),(c,d)$ are not L.I., the intersection points instead lie on a line, which is a circle of radius infinity. When the two conics only have $3,2$ or $1$ intersection point(s), the statement that all these points lie on a circle is trivially true.\n\n~Ross Gao"

Suppose that these parabolas intersect at four points.\n\nThen these points lie on the circle centered at point $(p_2, p_1)$ with radius $r = \\sqrt{2(p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_1 y_1 + p_2 x_2)}.$\n\nProof\n\nLet's introduce a coordinate system with the center at the point of intersection of the axes. Let the first (red) parabola have axis $x = 0,$ focal parameter $p_1$ and focus at point $A(0, –y_1), y_1 > 0.$ Let second (blue) parabola have axis $y = 0,$ focal parameter $p_2$ and focus at point $B(–x_2,0), x_2  > 0.$ Let us denote the angle between the vector connecting the focus of the first parabola and its point and the positive direction of the ordinate axis $2\\theta,$ its length $\\rho_1(\\theta),$ the angle between the vector connecting the focus of the second parabola and its point and the positive direction of the abscissa axis $2\\phi,$ its length $\\rho_2(\\phi).$ Then \\[\\rho_1(\\theta) = \\frac{p_1}{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}, \\rho_2(\\phi) = \\frac{p_2}{1 - \\cos(2\\phi)}.\\]\n\nAbscissa of the point of intersection is \\begin{align*} x =\\rho_1 \\sin(2\\theta) = p_1\\cot\\theta = \\rho_2 \\cos (2\\phi) - x_2 = \\frac{p_2}{2} (\\cot^2\\phi - 1)- x_2,\\end{align*} \\begin{align*} x^2 = p_1^2 \\cot ^2 \\theta , 2 p_1\\cot\\theta = p_2 \\cos^2 \\phi - p_2 - 2x_2 .\\end{align*} Ordinate of the point of intersection is \\begin{align*} y =\\rho_2 \\sin 2\\phi = p_2\\cot\\phi = \\rho_1 \\cos 2\\theta - y_1 = \\frac{p_1}{2} (\\cot^2\\theta - 1)- y_1,\\end{align*} \\begin{align*} y^2 = p_2^2 \\cot ^2 \\phi , 2 p_2\\cot\\phi = p_1 \\cos^2 \\theta - p_1 - 2y_1 .\\end{align*} The square of the distance from point of intersection to the point $(p_2, p_1)$ is \\begin{align*} r^2 = (x-p_2)^2 + (y-p_1)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2 p_1 y - 2 p_2 x + p_1^2 + p_2^2 .\\end{align*} After simple transformations, we get $r^2 = 2(p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_1 y_1 + p_2 x_2).$\n\nHence, any intersection point has the same distance $r$ from the point $(p_2, p_1).$\n\nSolution\n\nParameters of the parabola $y = x^2 – k$ are $p_1 = \\frac{1}{2}, y_1 = 20 + k – \\frac{1}{2}.$\n\nParameters of the parabola $\\frac{x}{2} = (y – 20)^2 – \\frac{k}{2}$ are $p_2 = \\frac{1}{4}, x_2 = k – \\frac{1}{4}  \\implies r^2 = 20 + \\frac{3k}{2}.$\n\nIf $r \\le 21, k \\le \\frac{842}{3},$ then integer $k \\le 280.$\n\nThe vertex of the second parabola is point $(– k,20)$ can be on the parabola $y = x^2 – k$ or below the point of the parabola with the same abscissa.

Since we start on the bottom, ending on the top means that we will have to switch an odd number of times; since we cannot switch twice in a row, over an eight-move period we can either make one or three switches. Furthermore, once we switch to a level we can choose one of two directions of traveling on that level: clockwise or counterclockwise (since we can't go back to our previous move, our first move on the level after switching determines our direction).\n\nCase 1: one switch. Our one switch can either happen at the start/end of our moves, or in the middle. There are $4 + 24 = 28$ ways to do this, outlined below. Subcase 1: switch happens at ends. If our first move is a switch, then there are two ways to determine the direction we travel along the top layer. Multiply by $2$ to count for symmetry (last move is a switch) so this case yields $2^2 = 4$ possibilities. Subcase 2: switch happens in the middle. There are six places for the switch to happen; the switch breaks the sequences of moves into two chains, with each having $2$ ways to choose their direction of travel. This case yields $6 \\cdot 2^2 = 24$ possibilities. Case 2: three switches. Either two, one, or none of our switches occur at the start/end of our moves. There are $16 + 96 + 64 = 176$ ways to do this, outlined below. (Keep in mind we can't have two switches in a row.) Subcase 1: start and end with a switch.

Subcase 2: one of our switches is at the start/end. WLOG our first move is a switch; moves $2$ and $8$ cannot be switches. We can choose $2$ from any of the remaining $5$ moves to be switches, but we have to subtract the $4$ illegal cases where the two switches are in a row (3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7).

If at least two switches are in a row, there are five places for the group of $2$ and four places for the third switch; however this overcounts the case where all three are in a row, which has $4$ possibilities.

        "content": "We know right away that $42\\not\\in S$ and $84\\not\\in S$ as stated in Solution 1.\n\nTo get a feel for the problem, let’s write out some possible values of $S$ based on the teacher’s remarks. The first multiple of 7 that is two-digit is 14. The closest multiple of six from 14 is 12, and therefore there are two possible sets of four consecutive integers containing 12 and 14; $\\{11,12,13,14\\}$ and $\\{12,13,14,15\\}$ . Here we get our first crucial idea; that if the multiples of 6 and 7 differ by two, there will be 2 possible sets of $S$ without any student input. Similarly, if they differ by 3, there will be only 1 possible set, and if they differ by 1, 3 possible sets.\n\nNow we read the student input. Each student says they can’t figure out what $S$ is just based on the teacher’s information, which means each student has to have a number that would be in 2 or 3 of the possible sets (This is based off of the first line of student input). However, now that each student knows that all of them have numbers that fit into more than one possible set, this means that S cannot have two possible sets because otherwise, when shifting from one set to the other, one of the end numbers would not be in the shifted set, but we know each number has to fall in two or more possible sets. For example, take $\\{11,12,13,14\\}$ and $\\{12,13,14,15\\}$ . The numbers at the end, 11 and 15, only fall in one set, but each number must fall in at least two sets. This means that there must be three possible sets of S, in which case the actual S would be the middle S.\nTake for example $\\{33,34,35,36\\}$ , $\\{34,35,36,37\\}$ , and $\\{35,36,37,38\\}$ . 37 and 34 fall in two sets while 35 and 36 fall in all three sets, so the condition is met. Now, this means that the multiple of 6 and 7 must differ by 1.\nSince 42 means the difference is 0, when you add/subtract 6 and 7, you will obtain the desired difference of 1, and similarly adding/subtracting 6 or 7 from 84 will also obtain the difference of 1. Thus there are four possible sets of $S$ ; $\\{34,35,36,37\\}$ , $\\{47,48,49,50\\}$ , $\\{76,77,78,79\\}$ and $\\{89,90,91,92.\\}$ . Therefore the sum of the greatest elements of the possible sets $S$ is $37+50+79+92=\\boxed{258}$\n\n~KingRavi"

Therefore, none of the students know the set for sure.\n\nPlaying around with the arrangement of the multiple of 6 and multiple of 7 shows that this is the only configuration viewed as ambiguous to all the students. (Therefore when they hear nobody else knows either, they can find out it is this configuration)\n\nConsidering $S$ as $\\{a,6j,7k,b\\}$ ,b is 2 mod 6 and 1 mod 7, so $b$ is 8 mod 42.

Similarly, if we are given a $b \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$ and we know that $0 \\pmod{7}$ is in $S$ , $S$ must be $(b, b+1, b+2, b+3).$ Hence, the only possibility for $a$ is $5, 6 \\pmod{7}.$\n\nIn either case, we are guaranteed there is a $6, 0, 1 \\pmod{7}$ value in $7$ .

        "content": "Recall that $1000$ divides this expression if $8$ and $125$ both divide it. It should be fairly obvious that $n \\geq 3$ ; so we may break up the initial condition into two sub-conditions.\n\n(1) $5^n \\equiv n \\pmod{8}$ . Notice that the square of any odd integer is $1$ modulo $8$ (proof by plugging in $1^2,3^2,5^2,7^2$ into modulo $8$ ), so the LHS of this expression goes $5,1,5,1,\\ldots$ , while the RHS goes $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,\\ldots$ . The cycle length of the LHS is $2$ , RHS is $8$ , so the cycle length of the solution is $\\operatorname{lcm}(2,8)=8$ . Indeed, the $n$ that solve this congruence are exactly those such that $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$ .\n\n(2) $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{125}$ . This is extremely computationally intensive if we try to calculate all $2^1,2^2,\\ldots,2^{100} \\pmod{125}$ , so we take a divide-and-conquer approach instead. In order for this expression to be true, $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{5}$ is necessary; it shouldn't take too long for us to go through the $20$ possible LHS-RHS combinations, considering that $n$ must be odd. We only need to test $10$ values of $n$ and obtain $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{20}$ or $n \\equiv 17 \\pmod{20}$ .\n\nWith this in mind we consider $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{25}$ . By the Generalized Fermat's Little Theorem, $2^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ , but we already have $n$ modulo $20$ . Our calculation is greatly simplified. The LHS's cycle length is $20$ and the RHS's cycle length is $25$ , from which their least common multiple is $100$ . In this step we need to test all the numbers between $1$ to $100$ that $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{20}$ or $n \\equiv 17 \\pmod{20}$ . In the case that $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{20}$ , the RHS goes $3,23,43,63,83$ , and we need $2^n \\equiv n \\equiv 2^3 \\pmod{25}$ ; clearly $n \\equiv 83 \\pmod{100}$ . In the case that $n \\equiv 17 \\pmod{20}$ , by a similar argument, $n \\equiv 97 \\pmod{100}$ .\n\nIn the final step, we need to calculate $2^{97}$ and $2^{83}$ modulo $125$ :\n\nNote that $2^{97}\\equiv2^{-3}$ ; because $8\\cdot47=376\\equiv1\\pmod{125},$ we get $2^{97} \\equiv 47\\pmod{125}$ .\n\nNote that $2^{83}$ is $2^{-17}=2^{-16}\\cdot2^{-1}$ . We have \\begin{align*} 2^{-1}&\\equiv63, \\\\ 2^{-2}&\\equiv63^2=3969\\equiv-31, \\\\ 2^{-4}&\\equiv(-31)^2=961\\equiv-39, \\\\ 2^{-8}&\\equiv1521\\equiv21, \\\\ 2^{-16}&\\equiv441, \\\\ 2^{-17}&\\equiv63\\cdot441\\equiv7\\cdot(-31)=-217\\equiv33. \\end{align*} This time, LHS cycle is $100$ , RHS cycle is $125$ , so we need to figure out $n$ modulo $500$ . It should be $n \\equiv 283,297 \\pmod{500}$ .\n\nPut everything together. By the second subcondition, the only candidates less than $1000$ are $283,297,783,797$ . Apply the first subcondition, $n=\\boxed{797}$ is the desired answer.\n\n~Ross Gao (Solution)\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM (Minor Reformatting)"

It is easy to check $n < 3$ don't work, so we have that $n \\geq 3$ . Then, $2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$ and $5^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}$ , so we just have $5^n \\equiv n \\pmod{8}$ and $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{125}$ . Let us consider both of these congruences separately.\n\nFirst, we look at $5^n \\equiv n \\pmod{8}$ . By Euler's Totient Theorem (ETT), we have $5^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ , so $5^5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$ . On the RHS of the congruence, the possible values of $n$ are all nonnegative integers less than $8$ and on the RHS the only possible values are $5$ and $1$ . However, for $5^n$ to be $1 \\pmod{8}$ we must have $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$ , a contradiction. So, the only possible values of $n$ are when $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\implies n = 8k+5$ .\n\nNow we look at $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{125}$ . Plugging in $n = 8k+5$ , we get $2^{8k+5} \\equiv 8k+5 \\pmod{125} \\implies 2^{8k} \\cdot 32 \\equiv 8k+5 \\pmod{125}$ . Note, for $2^n \\equiv n\\pmod{125}$ to be satisfied, we must have $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{5}$ and $2^n \\equiv n\\pmod{25}$ . Since $2^{8k} \\equiv 1\\pmod{5}$ as $8k \\equiv 0\\pmod{4}$ , we have $2 \\equiv -2k \\pmod{5} \\implies k = 5m-1$ . Then, $n = 8(5m-1) + 5 = 40m-3$ . Now, we get $2^{40m-3} \\equiv 40m-3 \\pmod{125}$ . Using the fact that $2^n \\equiv n\\pmod{25}$ , we get $2^{-3} \\equiv 15m-3 \\pmod{25}$ . The inverse of $2$ modulo $25$ is obviously $13$ , so $2^{-3} \\equiv 13^3 \\equiv 22 \\pmod{25}$ , so $15m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25} \\implies m = 5s$ . Plugging in $m = 5s$ , we get $n = 200s - 3$ .\n\nNow, we are finally ready to plug $n$ into the congruence modulo $125$ . Plugging in, we get $2^{200s-3} \\equiv 200s - 3 \\pmod{125}$ . By ETT, we get $2^{100} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125}$ , so $2^{200s- 3} \\equiv 2^{-3} \\equiv 47 \\pmod{125}$ . Then, $200s \\equiv 50 \\pmod{125} \\implies s \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\implies s = 5y+4$ . Plugging this in, we get $n = 200(5y+4) - 3 = 1000y+797$ , implying the smallest value of $n$ is simply $\\boxed{797}$ .\n\n~rocketsri"

More specifically, the pattern starts with $n=3$ , which means for every 100 n, $2^n \\mod 1000$ will repeat in a loop:\n\n$008{,}016{,}032{,}064{,}128{,}256{,}512{,}024{,}048{,}096{,}$ $192{,}384{,}768{,}536{,}072{,}144{,}288{,}576{,}152{,}304{,}$ $608{,}216{,}432{,}864{,}728{,}456{,}912{,}824{,}648{,}296{,}$ $592{,}184{,}368{,}736{,}472{,}944{,}888{,}776{,}552{,}104{,}$ $208{,}416{,}832{,}664{,}328{,}656{,}312{,}624{,}248{,}496{,}$ $992{,}984{,}968{,}936{,}872{,}744{,}488{,}976{,}952{,}904{,}$ $808{,}616{,}232{,}464{,}928{,}856{,}712{,}424{,}848{,}696{,}$ $392{,}784{,}568{,}136{,}272{,}544{,}088{,}176{,}352{,}704{,}$ $408{,}816{,}632{,}264{,}528{,}056{,}112{,}224{,}448{,}896{,}$ $792{,}584{,}168{,}336{,}672{,}344{,}688{,}376{,}752{,}504$\n\nMoreover, we might found that for every 20 consequtive integer, $2^n \\mod 100$ will repeat in a loop. Thus, by adding $5^n$ to first twenty element, which is $n=3$ to $n=22$ , we can get a pattern of last two digit of $2^n + 5^n \\mod{1000}$ , which is\n\n$33{,}41{,}57{,}89{,}53{,}$\n\n$81{,}37{,}49{,}73{,}21{,}$\n\n$17{,}09{,}93{,}61{,}97{,}$\n\n$69{,}13{,}01{,}77{,}29$\n\nBy subtracting n, we can also get following sequence:\n\n$30{,}37{,}52{,}83{,}46{,}$\n\n$73{,}28{,}39{,}62{,}09{,}$\n\n$04{,}95{,}78{,}45{,}80{,}$\n\n$51{,}94{,}81{,}56{,}07$\n\nNoticing that only when $n=3$ and $n=17$ , $2^n+5^n-n \\equiv 0 \\mod{10}$ , so $n=3+20k$ and $17+20k$ are our possible candidates. However, since the length of our pattern is 20, we know that $n=3+20k$ is definetely not answer, which only left us $n=17+20k$ .\n\nNow, we calculate the last three digit of $2^n+5^n-n$ at $n=17, n=37, n=57, n=77, n=97$ , which is $180{,}560{,}940{,}320{,}700$ .\n\nSince the pattern will repeat for every 100 consequtive integer, the only thing that could possibly change last three digit is -n, noticing that only when $n=97$ , $2^n+5^n-n \\equiv 0 \\mod 100$ . So the answer only could be $n=97+100k_2$ , by subtracting 700, which means adding 700 to n, we can get our final answer $n=\\boxed{797}$ .\n\nAlso, by this method we can ensure that $\\frac{2^n+5^n-n}{1000}$ is an integer only if $n=797+1000k$ , all the calculation can be done without a calculator (about 15 minutes or so), need some patience though.\n\nIf you are wondering, $2^{103} = 10{,}141{,}204{,}801{,}825{,}835{,}211{,}973{,}625{,}643{,}008$ .\n\n~henry_in_out"

First, let the distance between $n$ and the first perfect square greater than or equal to it be $k$ , making the values of $f(n+k)$ and $g(n+k)$ integers. Using this notation, we see that $f(n)=k+f(n+k)$ , giving us a formula for the numerator of our ratio. However, since the function of $g(n)$ does not add one to the previous inputs in the function until a perfect square is achieved, but adds values of two, we can not achieve the value of $\\sqrt{n+k}$ in $g(n)$ unless $k$ is an even number. However, this is impossible, since if $k$ was an even number, $f(n)=g(n)$ , giving a ratio of one. Thus, $k$ must be an odd number.\n\nThus, since $k$ must be an odd number, regardless of whether $n$ is even or odd, to get an integral value in $g(n)$ , we must get to the next perfect square after $n+k$ . To make matters easier, let $z^2=n+k$ .

Thus.\n\n\\[g(n)=(k+2z+1)+\\sqrt{n+k+2\\sqrt{n+k}+1}\\]\n\nHowever, note that the quantity within the square root is just $(z+1)^2$ , and so:\n\n\\[g(n)=k+3z+2\\]\n\nThus, \\[\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}=\\frac{k+z}{k+3z+2}\\]\n\nSince we want this quantity to equal $\\frac{4}{7}$ , we can set the above equation equal to this number and collect all the variables to one side to achieve\n\n\\[3k-5z=8\\]\n\nSubstituting back in that $z=\\sqrt{n+k}$ , and then separating variables and squaring yields that\n\n\\[9k^2-73k+64=25n\\]\n\nNow, if we treat $n$ as a constant, we can use the quadratic formula in respect to $k$ to get an equation for $k$ in terms of $n$ (without all the squares). Doing so yields\n\n\\[\\frac{73\\pm\\sqrt{3025+900n}}{18}=k\\]\n\nNow, since $n$ and $k$ are integers, we want the quantity within the square root to be a perfect square. Note that $55^2=3025$ . Thus, assume that the quantity within the root is equal to the perfect square, $m^2$ . Thus, after using a difference of squares, we have \\[(m-55)(m+55)=900n\\] Since we want $n$ to be an integer, we know that the $LHS$ should be divisible by five, so, let's assume that we should have $m$ divisible by five. If so, the quantity $18k-73$ must be divisible by five, meaning that $k$ leaves a remainder of one when divided by 5 (if the reader knows LaTeX well enough to write this as a modulo argument, please go ahead and do so!).\n\nThus, we see that to achieve integers $n$ and $k$ that could potentially satisfy the problem statement, we must try the values of $k$ congruent to one modulo five. However, if we recall a statement made earlier in the solution, we see that we can skip all even values of $k$ produced by this modulo argument.\n\nAlso, note that $k=1,6$ won't work, as they are too small, and will give an erroneous value for $n$ . After trying $k=11,21,31$ , we see that $k=31$ will give a value of $m=485$ , which yields $n=\\boxed{258}$ , which, if plugged in to for our equations of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ , will yield the desired ratio, and we're done.\n\nSide Note: If any part of this solution is not rigorous, or too vague, please label it in the margin with \"needs proof\". If you can prove it, please add a lemma to the solution doing so :)\n\n-Azeem H. (mathislife52)"

We have two cases to consider.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is odd and $a$ is even\n\nHere, we get $a=2k$ for some positive integer $k.$ Then, $b = 2k+1.$ We let $n = a^2-(2m+1)$ for some positive integer $m$ so $f(n) = 2k+2m+1$ and $g(n) = 2k+1+2m+1+4k+1 = 6k+2m+3.$\n\nWe set $\\frac{2k+2m+1}{6k+2m+3}=\\frac{4}{7},$ cross multiply, and rearrange to get $6m-10k=5.$ Since $k$ and $m$ are integers, the LHS will always be even and the RHS will always be odd, and thus, this case yields no solutions.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is even and $a$ is odd\n\nHere, we get $a=2k+1$ for some positive ineger $k.$ Then, $b=2k+2.$ We let $n = a^2-(2m+1)$ for some positive integer $m$ so $f(n)=2k+1+2m+1=2k+2m+2$ and $g(n)=2k+2+2m+1+4k+3 = 6k+2m+6.$\n\nWe set $\\frac{2k+2m+2}{6k+2m+6} = \\frac{4}{7},$ cross multiply, and rearrange to get $5k=3m-5,$ or $k=\\frac{3}{5}m-1.$ Since $k$ and $m$ are integers, $m$ must be a multiple of $5.$ Some possible solutions for $(k,m)$ with the least $k$ and $m$ are $(2,5), (5,10), (8,15),$ and $(11,20).$\n\nWe wish to minimize $k$ since $a=2k+1.$ One thing to keep in mind is the initial assumption $(a-1)^2 < n < a^2.$\n\nThe pair $(2,5)$ gives $a=2(2)+1=5$ and $n=5^2-(2(5)+1)=14.$ But $4^2<14<5^2$ is clearly false, so we discard this case.\n\nThe pair $(5,10)$ gives $a=2(5)+1=11$ and $n=11^2-(2(10)+1)=100,$ which is a perfect square and therefore can be discarded.\n\nThe pair $(8,15)$ gives $a=2(8)+1=17$ and $n=17^2-(2(15)+1)=258,$ which is between $16^2$ and $17^2$ so it is our smallest solution.\n\nSo, $\\boxed{258}$ is the correct answer.\n\n~mc21s"

Now, suppose 3 consecutive integers $a-1$ , $a$ , and $a+1$ , and $(a-1)^2 < n < a^2$ . When $g(n) > f(n)$ , $g(n)$ must have a different parity than $a$ , so that $f(n)$ 's recursive sequence ends on $a^2$ , while $g(n)$ continues to $(a+1)^2$ . If this condition is satisfied, we can figure out the value of $k$ based on $a$ . According to the definitions of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ , $f(n) = a+a^2-n,$ and $g(n) = (a+1)+(a+1)^2-n,$ which gives $k = 2a+2$ . And because of $f(n) + k = g(n)$ , $\\frac{k}{g(n)} = \\frac{3}{7},$ so cross multiplying gives $3g(n) = 14a+14$ . This means that $14a+14$ is divisible by 3, and thus $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ . The final thing left is to find the smallest $a$ such that the corresponding value of $g(n)$ exist. Simple guess and check should give that the smallest value of $a$ is $a = 17$ , which yields an answer of $n = \\boxed{258}$ .\n\n~ Marchk26"
